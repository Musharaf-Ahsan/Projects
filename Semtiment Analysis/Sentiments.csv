THIS IS A BAD CHARGER IT DOES NOT WORK PROPERLY AND IT HAS A REALLY BAD SHORTAGE. I HATE IT!,Strong Negative
I bought 10 of these.  They are the worst product I have ever used.  They DO NOT work as advertised.  Nothing sticks to them,Strong Negative
This does not work at all. And once you put it on it is so hard to took off. Never again!!!!,Strong Negative
It says it's compatible with all Motorola handsets...  It doesn't work at all with Motorola/Giant Talkabout FRS/GMRS/CB 2-way radios having 2.5mm jacks.  Very disappointing.,Strong Negative
"This fell apart after one use, and the person I called couldn't even hear me when it wasn't broken to pieces.  VERY disappointed! :(",Strong Negative
I tried putting my Galaxy S4 in the case and it kept popping out. It seems like the plastic casing is too small for the phone. Very disappointed.,Strong Negative
"Product quality of this item is very, very poor.  After charging my phone for 15 minutes the charger began to overheat and the charge on my phone started to fail.  Had to return this item for refund.",Strong Negative
The charger did come in and does charge my mp3 players like it's supposed to. The shipping was longer than what I paid for. However I thought the charger was a disconnected charger to where the cable could come off the base and connect to a computer so I'll have to order another charger that does what I need it to do.,Strong Negative
Crap do not buy will not work with any of the phones I have paid under four dollars.  I just trashed it,Strong Negative
i think i dropped my phone once or twice with this case on... No damage to case or phone so it does its job well.4 stars because it blocks wifi signal shortening the distance you can be from the WAP...  I guess this happens with all cases though...  :(,Strong Negative
I was disappointed in this product.  Not as advertised.  I would not recommend it for use as it doesn't 'grip' the item you set on it.,Strong Negative
"This is a must if you have a Nokia phone, too bad that Nokia dosent allow all of thier phones charge via USB. So you need this charger. You can use it with the Duracell USB backup battery so you have power on the go!!.",Strong Negative
I chose this rating because the product never came.  I dislike that they were no help in getting me this product.  I recommend that no one else buy from this person because you will receive no item.  It's hard to rate the quality of something that does not exist. :(,Strong Negative
"Every time I plug this so called ""product"" into iPhone 4, it says ""Impossible to charge with this device"". Or something like that. What is the reason of buying it?! Just another disappointment...",Strong Negative
"These things are terrible! At least the ones I got from ""itemsforless"". The cord pulled out at the phone end.Come on Amazon get these ""sellers"" off the web site! It's getting as bad as E-bay.",Strong Negative
Worked for 3 days then never worked again. Was very disappointed with this product. Would not recommend to anyone at all.,Strong Negative
"This is one of the worst Bluetooths I've had.  I thought I'd try it for the price but as the saying goes, &34;You get what you pay for&34;.",Strong Negative
i bought the aliph jawbone II bluetooth headset with noiseasssassin in black and i hated it it did not work like it suppose to.,Strong Negative
I got this headset when socom came out n still have it to this day.  Too bad all the accessories for headsets are for the newer one.,Strong Negative
You have to get a very very thin case for it to work on this case. And the belt loops broke after 3 months of use. I got the Grantwood iPhone holster instead.,Strong Negative
"I didn't like this prodct.  I dropped my phone on my carpeted floor and the corner broke, so that I could not use the cover. The sheild was very hard to put on the screen.  It was very difficult to get the air bubbles out.  It also darkened tte screen on the phone.",Strong Negative
My IPhone did not fit in the case - very disappointed.  Was looking forward to using the case with my phone.,Strong Negative
One end is longer than the other and its mic is bad i hate it and it broke after 2 months,Strong Negative
"I received it broken, and they didn't offer to replace it. You get what you pay for. Do not buy!!!!",Strong Negative
Very terrible protection too glossy and it bubbles ridiculously its horrible. Came in a pack of five went through all of the them in 2 days. Sucks,Strong Negative
I did not like this product.  Very difficult to apply to screen.  Air bubbles are terrible to get off the screen.,Strong Negative
"This cable dont work...im so dissapointed , this cable is junk, cannot believe they sent me a cable that doesnt work , what a waste of my money and time!!!!!! Ahhhhhhrrrr s***",Strong Negative
I bought a Samsung Infuse 4G and it didn't come with a charger but I already had the wall port for the USB Charger.So I ordered this.  It was delivered on time and it very tough so it won't tear.,Strong Negative
"The LG enV touch is an awful phone. The accessories work but it's just such an awful phone, everything that goes with it deserves a one star rating.",Strong Negative
"I ordered this charger for my Palm Pre.  It lasted 5 months and then the cable started to tear at the end, where the connection is that goes into the cell phone.  After a bit, wires were sticking out and it failed to charge my phone.  Piece of junk - I wouldn't buy this again!  Buy name brand stuff.  The one I got with my phone lasted longer than this rip off one did!",Strong Negative
This protector is too rigid and it's impossible to apply it without getting air bubbles. Don't buy this stuff.,Strong Negative
"I just got these in the pail. Put one on my phone and immediately was disappointed. It makes the screen have a bluish tint with the rainbow effect when you move it around and I get a headache just looking at the screen. It looks like I have 3d glasses on and am walking around in the sun. Definitely don't recommend and if I could upload a pic to this review I would, it's terrible",Strong Negative
I hate this I purchased this for my iPod and to o some exercise but the stupid earpiece keeps falling out. Don't waste your money on it,Strong Negative
This was an o.k. screen protector. It was not a mirror. If you get it to be a mirror you will be disappointed.,Strong Negative
"I didn't like this produvt.  Very hard to attach to the phone.  The air bubbles were very difficult to remove, even with the plastic card to run over the screen.",Strong Negative
This charger did not charge at all! I was upset and just tossed it into the trash can. Very disappointed.,Strong Negative

this thing does not charge an iphone for crap. might work on a ipod but it def didnt work for my phone.,Strong Negative
I ordered the item to fix my itouch but the screen was already cracked and it didnt come w/accecories to put it on and i am really frustrated.,Strong Negative
"I really like this case.  It is horribly bulky, but it got the job done.  The belt clip is worthless.",Strong Negative
Worked well. But after a while I got sick of swapping batteries out of the phone. It became a pain.,Strong Negative
"IT HOLDS THE PHONE NICEBUT THE SUCTION CUP KEEP COMING OFF LOOSEWHICH IS SUX, EVERY TIME I DRIVE INTO BUMPS AND BAD ROADIT JUST SLID OUT , I HAD TO PUT WATER ON THE CUP FOR IT TO HOLDTHEN I JUST GOT TIRED IF IT AND I THREW IT AWAY",Strong Negative
These screen protectors are very bad. I think they are made out of plastic wrap. I didn't even try to apply them as they would offer very poor protection. Don't buy them if you want a quality product. Keep looking!,Strong Negative
I wouldn't even give it one star. It deserves no stars. It does not work. It doesn't even power up my phone. Can't take any charge. It's a dud!!! Do not buy!! I never write reviews but I felt inclined to do so for this crap. You have been warned.,Strong Negative
"Not as advertized! Item VERY hard to install, spray gets everywhere, fingerprints are IMPOSSIBLE to avoid; scratched with the supplied sqeegee when installing! I threw it in the trash!!!!!!! Ordered another brand.",Strong Negative
Although it fits well on my HTC EVO But i couldn't get rid of the bubbles makes it very difficult to see what is on the screen and use your phone.,Strong Negative
"When I put it in my pocket/purse without the protector no scratches...I put on the protector and now when I put it my pocket/purse the scratches are horrible. Just got them and already used 3, it makes my phone ugly, Ive had a diff brand on my other phones and never had this issue. YOU GET WHAT U PAY FOR...CHEAP!",Strong Negative
This cover is so thick that the touch screen does not work after it is put on. Do not buy!!!,Strong Negative
"Husband tried them on a whim.  Anything like this is worthless, I have found.  They are just trying to make money off of junk.",Strong Negative
I ordered the Premium Bling Luxurious Design Diamont Crystal Case and did not get that. Instead I received a Bumper. I'm disappointed and will not order from this vendor anymore.,Strong Negative
I vomit when I think of this product. If the devil had children that hated every living thing...they would be the ones that designed this product. Damn you to he11 demons...,Strong Negative
"I was really sad when I saw my Mirror Screen Protector, It came badly Scratch I had to through it away. Sad they sold something like that.",Strong Negative
"Worked for about a week and then no longer worked, I was very disappointed in this to say the least.",Strong Negative
"I get what I paid for.  I didn't spend a lot of money, and this charger broke within a few months.  A very bad charger, and a very bad company.  Look elsewhere!",Strong Negative
"Ordered this for my fiance for his iPhone and he needed a cover bad, so I got him one. He loves it and keeps his phone protected.",Strong Negative
It's hard to rate this item because I still have not got it yet. :-( I do not know what the hangup is.,Strong Negative
"i rate this casea 6 out of 10, looks just like the pictures but the material is very thin and flimpsey.",Strong Negative
"This case will end your iphone 4 call like hotcakes.I think is it a bad design, everytime the case is on and you talk on the phone it will end the call for you.Removed it and problem solved.DO NOT BUY this case.",Strong Negative
"This protector has bad cuts around the home button, camera, ear piece.  It is impossible to have it adhere around those because of all the imperfections.But the worst is that the front sticker that comes in the protector and is supposed to be removed after applying it, won't come off, leaves horrible glue residues.I will just leave it on the phone until I replace it, what I will do today if I can, to avoid scratches.DEFINITELY A BAD PROTECTOR!  I am so disappointed, in the past I purchased another protector with the same name, and it was acceptable.Another point that shows the unreliability of this product is that out of the 4 that I bought, they came with different cuts, though all sharing the same problems regarding the front sticker and bad cuts.  In fact I'd say it's bad even as a temporary solution...",Strong Negative
Came cracked :(,Strong Negative
bad cable. works for charging but not for data transfer.,Strong Negative
beads fall off and it is junk regret making purchase as it is worthless in terms of protection and doesn't wear well,Strong Negative
This screen protector is absolutely horrible! I could never get the bubbles out.  Made the phone look dirty.  Do not order!,Strong Negative
Identical to the battery it came with and does the job.  Too bad they burn out after a year... but that's the deal,Strong Negative
Very hard to work this case!!! and will notrecommend!! And i bought 3 of them and through them away.,Strong Negative
"But in the end I regretted buying it, because switching out the battery became annoying. So I stopped doing it.",Strong Negative
HATED the quality.  The dock was sleek and did what a charge and sync dock should do.  The problem came when the connector to the back of the dock broke inside and I was unable to pry it out or fix it.  Too bad.,Strong Negative
The picture for this item is wrong. I received a broken case & it surrounds the screen which is very ugly to  me.I do not recommend this!?!!!!,Strong Negative
I used it for 2 weeks the it stopped holding the phone on any position it would just spin from horizontal position. And vertical :(,Strong Negative
IM ORDERED 5 PHONES FROM BLUTEKUSA AND THEY SEND ME ALL OF THEM WITHOUT THE 2GB MICROSD CARDS THAT HAS TO BE INCLUDED IN THE BOX AND THE BOXES WERE DAMAGE LIKE THEY PUT ALL THE PHONES IN BAD WAY INSIDE THE BOXES. WTF WITH THIS SERVICE. I DONT RECOMEND BUYING FROM BLUTEKUSA IF THIS ARE THEIR BEHAVIOR OF DELIVERING PRODUCTS TO ITS COSTUMERS. FIX IT AND ILL CHANGE REVIEW.,Strong Negative
I have 2 if these cases . One is where the paint is literally coming off the case & after one day I emailed them saying I would like another . So they sent me another & that had a clear plastic over it which is peeling off . Horrible ! Both of my cases looks terrible .,Strong Negative

"I needed something to go over my screen, so I gave these a try, however, they are almost impossible to put on!",Strong Negative
"no a2dp, (no streaming audio), practically all of bluetooth headsets stream audio these days, plus annoyingly beeps in my ear all the time for no reason",Strong Negative
"Having gotten spoiled on the flip I was truly disappointed with what you had to do to use this ear piece with the flip you flip the mic it's on you flip it again it's off with this you have to turn the mic pressed the very small button. However my husband likes it so I gave it to him, thus 3 stars",Strong Negative

"this item was shipped on time, was very poor quality, looked nothing like the picture, the rhinestones were falling off and shifting before I even took it out of the package.",Strong Negative
"A 'must have' product to protect a phone, but regardless of repeated efforts, I can't get rid of the air bubbles. They are not visible when the display is on, but just looks bad otherwise.",Strong Negative
The feeling of this screen protector is just disgusting. It's not smooth and it's all blurry. I hate this protector. Will not buy another.,Strong Negative
I wrote a bad review on this to begin with because I was the one that didnt know how to put the protective screen on so once I watched the you tube video I got it.,Strong Negative
"Installed the screen, turned on the phone and...white screen. The LCD does not work correctly. Now I'm frustrated AND behind schedule.",Strong Negative
Terrible absolutely terrible! The battery lasted about 3 days and then stopped charging! Asked them to send another and of course they did but then that one lastwd about a week if that! Plus it isnt cut right and every time he would set his phone down or move it the battery would shift and his phone would shut off! Horrible quality if you ask me!,Strong Negative
All the stones were falling off. I had to break the case to take it off. I was very unhappy with this product.,Strong Negative
its all lose. dosent hug the phone. bad product. wouldnt recommend. . . . .  . . . . . .,Strong Negative
"I am disappointed that this seller has Fascinate listed in the title.  Batteries do not charge in phone.  Also, they heat up while in the phone.  After installing and powering on I get a message that the battery is unsupported.",Strong Negative
Too bad the Xoom has it's connections on the bottom....and an hdmi connection seems to lock the screen the 'wrong' waynot a problem with the cable - it works well - but a problem with the Xoom - calling Motorola to check.but it is a gee-or-geous picture!,Strong Negative
"It never kept my iPhone standing at all. Was the worst stand I have ever purchased. Though you get what you pay for, for the price.",Strong Negative
"the product is not the one in the photo, he was sent packing without her, very badly. I feel like I lost my money",Strong Negative
This screen protector was not a match for the Tab 3. It did not have the correct cuts for the tablet. Highly disappointed.,Strong Negative
"Its just a dock, nothing to say about it.I use it at home on my desktop to sync/charge my iphone while im on the computer.the bad thing is that you need to take off your iphone skin in order to use this dock(or any dock as i have seen).",Strong Negative
"Broke the minute I pulled it out of the box, after taking a month to arrive from China. Very bad item.",Strong Negative
Works just as well if not better than the one supplied by Samsung.  Can't complain for the price as I was expecting to pay anywhere from 10-20 for a stupid charger.,Strong Negative
this thing is so badly made the wire broke when i push it into the tab...idk if its me or the material,Strong Negative
The thing might work then in again it might not plus the customer service sucks even worst this was a bad deal i wish i never bought it but never again i promise you that,Strong Negative
I gave these to my wife as they are worthless driving a car. Slippery does not begin to describe it.,Strong Negative
"It started breaking within a week.  The rubber inside started ripping, and the plastic broke off.  Very disappointing for an Otterbox case.",Strong Negative
Bad products every sinlee piece stopped working in a matter of two weeks i would not recommend for you to buy at all,Strong Negative
Lousy product and Very lousy customer service. Asked if there was anything they could do to resolve the issue then proceeded to communicate as if I did not know what I was doing with the screen protector. Do not recommend the vendor at all. Did not offer to replace defective product nor agree to when asked.,Strong Negative
"This phone case is awful. I was so excited to get it in the mail and when I opened it, it was broken! Never order for this seller, their awful.",Strong Negative
Slot for the charger has a lip inside so the car charger doesn't go all the way in with the bumper on. Guess I could try cutting out the groove with an Xacto knife but why should I have to. Oh well.,Strong Negative
I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT. I HAVE BEEN WAITING ON IT STILL I HAVE NOT YET GOTTEN IT'S BEEN MONTH AND HALF AND I STILL WAITING. TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE THERE NO WAY TO EMAIL THEM OR NOTHING. I HIGHLY NOT RECOMMEND TO BUY NOTHING WITH THIS SELLER IF YOU DON'T WANNA LOSE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!,Strong Negative
"This has to be the worst thing I ever bought off amazon.. and I buy cheap crap all the time, knowing it could be crap ! the protector would not stick to my phone, causing it to bubble all the time. and GOD I HATED THOSE BUBBLES !! GRRRR !! I had to just toss it where it belonged, IN THE TRASH ! it wasn't even a privacy screen protector.. it was just dark. People standing next to me, or even behind me could still peek and be nosey. Horrible BUY !",Strong Negative
"I keep it on my keychain since I get my iPhone taken up in school every week, I just pop out my sim card and hand my phone over. I always keep 2 spare iPhone fours in my backpack. The teacher gives me a dirty look when I remove my sim card.",Strong Negative

This has to be the absolute worst case we have purchased yet. didn't even have the opportunity to put it on the phone because it broke while in that process!!!! very UNHAPPY with this product!!,Strong Negative
I like it but the in side case was so hard to put on and take off its the harders thing I've had to do like color but don't like having to fight with the inside case :(,Strong Negative

Within a day of having this all the charging prongs had bent and it went into the junk drawer where it remained forgotten until I was browsing my order history. This is worthless.,Strong Negative
"When I got the screen protectors they had stuff on the part that sticks which when trying to get it off, it just smeared. All 3 protectors had to be disposed of. DO NOT BUY. HORRIBLE",Strong Negative

Bad quality. Keep looking,Strong Negative

The flap is so annoying. My phone hangs out the sides. I don't even know what I was thinking when I bought this.,Strong Negative
"My s/o bought this for use in his vehicle. It does what it does well, though I find it obtrusive and awkward looking. I guess I'm just used to the ones that clip neatly to your visor. So if you're frugal and don't care what the inside of your vehicle looks like, then this is the transmitter for you!",Strong Negative
"The day it got here the sleep/wake button fell of the case. I have ordered tons of these bumpers but this one was one of the worst made, but you get what you pay for.",Strong Negative

Worst screen protector I have ever seen. You cant get the bubbles out and if you try you will scratch the screen. PLUS the liquid they give you and the instructions are very stupid.

Amazon recommended a battery charging cradle for a Note i700 or something like that.  I added it because I thought it was convenient.

"....i feel stupid thinking of all the money i spended in cases before :/This is the best,not just the colors...But materials.",Strong Negative
"The title says it all. The color issue isn't that bad, but this just is not functional. The buttons are awful. Hard plastic buttons you can't press.",Strong Negative
Case was very difficult to put on and take off.  The power and volume buttons had to be mashed to get them to work.  Would not recommend.,Strong Negative

ITS BEEN THREE MOTHS IS RIDICULOUS HOW THEY TAKE THE MONEY BUT THEY DON'T SEND THE PRODUCT ITS STUPID AND HATE IT EVEN THOUGH I HAVEN'T EVEN GOT IT.............,Strong Negative
These protectors are thick and they interfere with the viewing of the screen. They do not stick to the glass at all I had it on the phone for less then 3 minutes and it began t curl off the sides. hate hate hate this product.,Strong Negative
I didn't like this screen protector. You couldn't see the screen from your reflection. There was also a bad glare. Not happy with this one at all,Strong Negative

"Very, very thin. No protection for your phone. So flimsy, it falls off when caught on anything or put in your pocket.  Also has a soft/slick texture. Do not recommend at all.",Strong Negative
"annoying, hand cramping grip and one of the magnets is covered by the ugly rocket type cover, making it useless.  It's not as sturdy as people claim, the tip has already bent all weird making it practically unusable now.",Strong Negative
bad,Strong Negative
Horrible cardboard/foam case... it looks like something you can make your self with art supplies from micheals. never going to use it. You get what you pay for.,Strong Negative
"Film does an awful job of adhering to the screen. So, prepare for your careful placement efforts to go to waste.White tape tabs are GLUED on instead of mildly tacked on. This means paper and glue will be stuck on your films.And the absolutely worst part of this product is the FRAUDULENT claim that rates this 3H hardness. Even the included squeegee will leave horrible scratches all over this terrible product. That is empirical evidence, so there's no talking one's way out of it.DO NOT BUY!",Strong Negative
I like that I can still talk on the phone when it is in the case and my screen won't get dirty!! I wish it just came with some designs on it.,Strong Negative
Got this for my fiance and he loves it. Gets 3 days out of it without fail. I would buy this again!,Strong Negative
The case isn't too bad.  The rubber seems to move a lot when trying to press it into the belt clip.,Strong Negative
I got my headphones and they feel like they could break easily a little disappointed. While I'm listening to music I can hardly hear the base.,Strong Negative
These adhesive strips do the trick.  They worked to adhere my iPad screen to the iPad. Too bad my screen still doesn't work.,Strong Negative
This product is too dark even to be Anti-Spy.  It does not cover the screen.  The worst item I have ever purchased.  Could not return the item,Strong Negative

"The bottom of this case is very thin just in front of the recharge plug. I expect it to break soon. Otherwise, it works as stated.",Strong Negative
My toggle buttons are difficult to get to. I had to cut out some additional space out in order to plug my charging cable in. Very inconvenient .  The look and feel of this case I like a lot. That is why I was so disappointed.,Strong Negative
This case is just awful I hate it...I'm glad I didn't buy the bundle...its just awful I hate it I think I trashed it,Strong Negative
Just freaking awful item is not describe case is cracked in half there is not jewels on it probably at time but their all in the bottom of the plastic bag it comes in. Never going to order from yall again.,Strong Negative

These are horrible dont even cover the screen at all. About a quarter inch all the way around the screen thats not covered. Not worth wasting a couple bucks.,Strong Negative
This was not a Hello Kitty. It was just a cat with a bow. I'm so disappointed. This is not what I ordered,Strong Negative

Too bad i don't have the phone anymore wish they would make some like that for my s3 and my iphone.,Strong Negative

wel the title say it all. The phone case falls apart and it's a piece of crap you shouldn't get,Strong Negative
"This product made the screen impossible to see in the sunlight. Would NEVER buy this product ever again, nor would I suggest you buy it.",Strong Negative
Very difficult to apply without having bubbles in your field of vision. I'm going &34;commando&34; now! Must be an easier way!,Strong Negative
"Was hard to look at. Horrible. Screen looked broken, night and day difference with it on & off. Don't buy",Strong Negative

"Freaked when I saw it come in the mail, please don't swivel the camera eye around a lot or it'll break :(",Strong Negative
"I don't know if i got a bad batch or what. I have bought other Tech Armor products and had no issues, but these wouldn't install correctly, and looked like crap.",Strong Negative
"I hate these covers. They did in a pinch when I didn't have one, but they muffle callers so badly that I have to remove them when I'm talking. And the heat generated by the phone when in one of these cases is actually uncomfortable to the touch. This is a do not buy.",Strong Negative
"I purchased these for my Note 2 and they sound terrible. I thought it was my phone's audio controls but when I plugged them up to my computer, they sounded even worst.",Strong Negative
"piece of crap case, falls off the phone all the time",Strong Negative
"I like it, it does what its supposed to do, I just don't like how in a few weeks the rubber is going to stretch and the belt bucket in my opinion is just horrible, worst ive ever used, and the kick stand is hard to take out.",Strong Negative
These protectors are awful. They are impossible to get on your screen and get all the bubbles out. I was never able to get one without bubbles. I even asked two other people to see if they get it on without the bubbles. And they couldn't even get it on without bubbles.,Strong Negative
ugly but it works,Strong Negative
I did my order on February 5Estimated between  arrival between February 11 and 14Today is February 17 and I have no notice about it. Disappointing.,Strong Negative

"not the same product that's is shown in advertisement. I am really disappointed:( with this item and wish to return, this item for  the product that was advertise!",Strong Negative
I did not like this cover. She squeezes the remaining cases. To take the cover is virtually impossible to do this without hurting your fingers,Strong Negative
"These screen protectors will protect you phone screen. However when you peel off the protective film, they become magnets for dust. They are almost impossible to install without some dust between.",Strong Negative
The cable came apart at the base of the pin piece within a week of receiving it. Now it no longer works. I hate spending my money on something that doesn't work.,Strong Negative
This thing sucks!  It is sooooo loooooose on my iphone 5 :(  Worst bumper I've ever had...marginally unusable.  Too bad I bought 2!,Strong Negative
"I dropped my phone on my driveway.  The plastic protective base BROKE; split in two.  I contacted OtterBox and they immediately issued a replacement, but I gave it away.  It's not as protective as the Defender.",Strong Negative
"The camera hole is cut too small, and so there is a terrible flare when you take a flash picture, and a circle around non-flash pictures. I don't think you should have to remove the phone from the case to take pictures. This manufacturing flaw should be corrected.",Strong Negative
The case snapped where the volume buttons are. The part of the case that covers the volume buttons is very thin.,Strong Negative
I don't like it.  It smells nasty  I can't get rid of the stench!!!  This item is not worth shipping,Strong Negative
It charges it once and a while but that's it couldn't use for sinking or anything else plugging into my car very disappointing,Strong Negative
The worst purchase I've ever done&8230; it came with out any buttons so I can't control the volume nor I can control the power button.,Strong Negative

"The product is terrible to peal off, and hard to place on the phone. I would not recommend this to anyone,",Strong Negative
"this product is terrible.  the back 'protector' is in 3 separate pieces, which was very difficult to adhere.  For the price, choose another screen shield.",Strong Negative
"Before ordering I read some reviews and was somewhat discouraged to buy, but at the end I bought anyway and let me tell you that those bad reviews were wrong!",Strong Negative

"Ordered this item to connect a tablet to my TV.  Nothing ever worked on this item.  Could not get any signal at all, even the charger didn't work. Very disappointed!",Strong Negative
"Didnt work with my galaxy s3 as advertized. A real disappointment. Skiva sends me a ""one time email"" with NO contact info asking me to contact them before posring a negative review about them. Go figure. Wish I had read all the bad reviews before wasting my monwy on this rubbish.",Strong Negative
The reality is that this type of prodcut doesnt seem tomwork with the note ....the fact is that when I used the pen the protector got scratched .... After a cuople of month it was really unpleasant,Strong Negative

Horrible horrible horrible horrible horrible case it was too hard and it cut my damn phone I hate it so much it even started to strip and the bow fell off in no time,Strong Negative
I was quite disappointed. It feels like plastic and was very hard to put on or remove.,Strong Negative

Battery inserts sideways???  Won't stay in.  I have never seen a design like this one.  Pathetic.  Poor Quality.  Will not charge battery because it wont hold the battery in sideways.,Strong Negative
"Very scary product..looked like a RAT tail.. I guess it was what was advertised, however it looked creepy to me",Strong Negative
like the look and feel but one of the features of my iphone 5 is the slide up list from the bottom but I stopped using this case because it's difficult to activate that feature :(,Strong Negative
Needed a screen protector for my iPad but I hate when there is a glare. These anti glare protectors do just as they say they do.,Strong Negative
"I returned this case the day I received it. I used it for an hour and I have a card in one of the slots. The magnetic closure demagnetized the card causing it to no longer work. Besides that, this case was terribly made! There were patched of color missing on the TPU part of the case and it was detaching from the case as well. I would not recommend this case.",Strong Negative
"As a case, totally decent... as a kickstand, awful, awful, awful... I don't even know how someone could let something like this out of the factory without testing it.  With the least amount of use and pressure, within a few days, the kickstand broke.",Strong Negative
"Wouldn't charge my phone correctly, instead it drained the battery and then charged it, quite annoying. I would not buy this again.",Strong Negative
Product warpped and show discolouration after period of usage. Not recommended for dirty environment as it will stained the case,Strong Negative
It's very difficult to get it out of my pockets with the gel case on it. I ended up opting for something lightweight and plastic instead.,Strong Negative
"I purchased the EasyAcc battery bank and after reading the instructions found I needed the charger if i wish to continue usage.A bit disappointed charger was not included with battery bank, so I had to wait to receive charger before I could use my battery bank again.That I can remember neither Amazon or EasyACC recommended the purchase of this charger?The charger fully charges my battery bank in approximately one hour.",Strong Negative

"The bling did not fall off but color got dirty & started peeling off after a week, I guess you get what you pay for.",Strong Negative
the cord didn't work after i used it like four or five time so i am unhappy with it but maybe i just have a defective one,Strong Negative
Poor quality.  This wallet broke apart as soon a I tried to put my credit cards into the slots.  Do not buy!!!!,Strong Negative

Does not stay plugged into the device. Not not charge my device. Was very disappointed with this product would not buy again.,Strong Negative
Unfortunately this product did not work with our ipad 2.  We connected this to an Bad Elf GPS device and to the ipad and it doesn't recognize the GPS device.  It will charge the ipad but that's it.  We tried another cable with the GPS and it works.  This one didn't work at all.,Strong Negative
It does what it says: Base protection with no added bulk. You literally cannot tell that this case is on the phone!,Strong Negative
It doesnt work. It the worst. My cellphone was wet for the case's fault. I dont recommend it...By the way,Strong Negative

"This cable does not charge my IPad Mini.  When I contacted Brand X they said it is because the cord is too long.  They should not advertise it as a Charging Syncing Cable then!!  This is the link I used for the purchase and Brand X &34;Thank You&34; slip was in the package that said contact them before leaving feedback.  I did that, but they said they couldn't help me because I purchased using a different Amazon Seller.  VERY DISAPPOINTED.  False advertising if Brand X knows a 9' ft cord can't charge!!!!!",Strong Negative
This battery was absolutely horrible. I charged the battery 100% and when I placed it in my phone..the phone repeatedly shut down...the battery went completely dead in less than an hour. Very disappointed with this purchase would not suggest this purchase to anyone,Strong Negative
"Terrible product. Item was bought from Amazon warehouse deals and it was defective. The item would charge the phone intermittently and after 7-10 days after gifting to my wife it stopped working. Now it won't even work as a paper weight as it is ugly and worthless.Can't believe amazon would sell defective items, even through warehouse deals after having received them as a return from another buyer. Poor quality check and poorly made charger. What a waste!",Strong Negative
it gets the job done. sadly my ipad was bended at the corner so I can not put it on without cutting a corner of it.,Strong Negative
Terrible all I gotta say twice,Strong Negative
"Does not charge the IPhone at all, very bad device",Strong Negative
When I plugged this in I got a message on my iPhone 5S that this cable was not iOS7 certified so I just threw the cable that came with away and used the Apple certified cable.Way to expensive to not get a certified cable with it!,Strong Negative

"These earphones are some of the worst earphones I have ever bought. They are Samsung, so I thought they would be alright. The part of the earphone that actually goes in your ear is terrible! It is large and bulky and does not stay in your ear. They are very uncomfortable and awkward; I wouldn't buy these again.",Strong Negative
do not like it does do what it saids but i hate the design of this case not to mention once you get it on its it on i thought id break my screen trying to get it off.,Strong Negative
"I was a little geeked out to get one of these for my birthday. I'm tired of having my phone sitting in my cupholder or flailing around my front seat. Too bad the bendy arm that connects the neck to the cigarette adapter base broke 4 hours after I installed this. Could be a defective unit, could be I'm stronger than I realize. But either way, buyer beware.",Strong Negative
very unhappy this item never made it to my home and my grandbaby loves hello kitty. i was getting this for and she keeps aking where it is,Strong Negative
"It does what it claims.  Bad thing is, my wife took it and I may have to buy another one.",Strong Negative

No problems with them on my samsung galaxy nesus or the LG optimus g pro but they won't work with a samsung galaxy s4 :(,Strong Negative
"I got it for the mirror but I didn't read the reviews before purchasing. It makes using the phone impossible when you're out, no problem indoors though. The rainbow on the screen is annoying too.",Strong Negative
"broke after two days.  could have been the installer, doubtful.",Strong Negative
I was very disappointed that the cord did not work upon arrival. I ordered it because I needed the extra long cable. The quality was awful and what can I say? It didn't work. Had to get a refund.,Strong Negative
well when i ordered this item i thought it was carbon both way but i got disappointing when i received this. its plastic inside!!!,Strong Negative

These cords are horrible it Took twice as long to charge my galaxy s4. Then they broke in a week do not buy them!!,Strong Negative
I like the case but after having it almost a month it got dirty and when I tried cleaning it the dirt wont come off.,Strong Negative
"This thing is a piece of crap. Well.....you get what you pay for. I received this item today and plugged my headset into it and then plugged it into my phone. When I was done using it, I attempted to take it out. Lo and behold, the bloody casing comes off of the thing and the adapter was still stuck in my phone! On my way to the UPS drop box ASAP! I do not recommend",Strong Negative

Very tough case.,Strong Negative
The screen had line in it. It would detect touch and work but the screen had a terrible green tint with lines in it.,Strong Negative
"It kept 2 tablets and a phone powered throughout a 5 hour flight. We watched movies and listened to music without worrying about running out of power. There was still a lot of power remaining at the end of the flight. I now carry it in my handbag because my Galaxy S3 phone burns through batteries like crazy. I used to have to carry 3 spare batteries but now, I just carry the Poweradd Pilot.",Strong Negative
"Everyone says they can't hear me. They say it sounds like I'm in a tunnel. When trying to type or talk on this phone, it's like the cover pushes the buttons. I hate it.",Strong Negative

Horrible case...,Strong Negative

Ugly,Strong Negative
For some reason does not work with the galaxy note 3 and makes phone flash on and off. Very disappointed.,Strong Negative
bad cables,Strong Negative
"It makes placing the note 3 on a table awkward and not sit flush with the table. This one charges faster than the fone salesman one, but wireless charging at night does not make a difference if its @ 600mAh or 900...",Strong Negative
what I ordered did not come.  This is showing three pieces and that is what I ordered.  The one that came is just a two piece which is useless to me since I need the adaptor part of it.  Very very disappointed,Strong Negative
"The case is clear....good product to buy, you will not be unhappy",Strong Negative

I didn't like it at all. It looks like someone printed the image because it looks really bad. I regret getting it :(,Strong Negative
"The volume button is bad sometimes. And the earphone jack hole and the speaker hole are switched, but u could stilll plug in your headphones. The case is tooo silocone but yea its cheaper on ebay",Strong Negative
"On April 28, I bought a Moto G case in purple color and it came in pink!!! What's happened?? This a terrible mistake for me because I sent to southamerica and I can't return this item!!!",Strong Negative
"If you don't have one, get it! You will not be disappointed.  For this price you just cannot go wrong.",Strong Negative
"This didn't work on my iPhone. When I used it while hiking, the earphones didn't work, so I had to hold it in my hand as I walked and listened to the speaker.I was also disappointed (my bad) to see that it didn't use the lightning connector on the phone to charge, but rather the mini-usb connection on the case. Inconvenient.",Strong Negative
Very thin!!,Strong Negative
Had a very bad smell.,Strong Negative
"I have gotten these for all the phones in the house all of us have glasses as it is, and glare was just horrible strain on our eyes. Now not a soul has a problem at all.",Strong Negative
"Worked for about one day then stopped working, it did not work for my iPhone 5, it was very disappointing.",Strong Negative
I am disappointed that the 1A didn't work with my iPad.  That's what I get for buying a cheap adapter.,Negative
Purchased two and we put one in each car. Now we charge our ipad and iohone together. Can also use to power my Galaxy Note 2 or recharge other USB devices. If you have to think about it you need counseling,Negative
It looked like it was used! It was broken when it got to be the paint job was horrible.I would never get it again,Negative
"Was here right on time.Wall adapter what I expected and works well but dose Not Have Quick-Charge As This ad states and that was the,Whole reason I chose this chager so that is horribly disappointing and inconvenient ..... The micro usb is useless it looks and acts cheaply made, and dose not fit well in to ports an either end will periodically stop working and my phone will freeze and turn off periodically as well....I know its the usd because I tried it in several devices and adapters and it had the same problems....I Will never order from Amazon Again Only two orders out of 13 have come without Defect or Wrong Probuct!Ugh!",Negative
"I only trust HTC accessories for HTC phones having bad luck with aftermarket products that are cheaper, but cheap is expensive.",Negative
poor manufacturing quality the connector is too long and does not properly fit in my phone. I would not buy this.,Negative
"I got this to charge my Samsung Galaxy S2 but it ALWAYS came unplugged from the phone, whenever the phone would be moved it falls out and even just resting on a flat surface it would eventually find its way out of the phone. I had to buy another USB cord because I became very frustrated with this",Negative
"Looking at the price, I ordered 2 of these.It served the purpose initially. But in few months one of them stopped working.that's 50% hit rate. Though, I don't what's the life for the other charger.",Negative
"Not much to say, here.  This little charger works well and it was a lot less expensive than Sprint store.",Negative
it was the wrong one.The male end does not fit the Iphone 4s .  Once it was pulled out it would not retract,Negative
Battery would not charge in iPhone. iPhone shut down after 2 minutes of being powered up. Had to throw it away.,Negative
I bought this set and have repaired my android a few times already and it's a must have tool set when working on such small electronics,Negative
"I have never bought an actual set in a box before.  Over the years I have just cobbled together an odd assortment of small screwdrivers.  This was well rated, inexpensive, and in a case.  It is all that I expected.  It works for me.",Negative
These things were terrible.  The &34;Boom&34; would keep pulling the ear but out of my ear and I couldn't keep anything in place. The cord was very flimsy... It was just an all around bad buy.  Wouldn't do it again.,Negative
"This thing is a waste of paper, it doesn't give u any better reception. This is a total rip off in my book :-(",Negative
"DO NOT USE THIS THOUGH IF YOUR PHONE IS STILL UNDER WARRANTY CUZ US CELLULAR SAID IT VOIDED MY WARRANTY, BUT US CELLULAR IS THE WORST CELL PHONE CARRIER OUT THERE. I SHOULD NOT HAVE EVEN NEEDED THIS WITH A BRAND NEW SAMSUNG GALAXY S3 BUT I DID...THE INSTRUCTIONS COULD HAVE BEEN A LITTLE BETTER IS MY ONLY COMPLAINT",Negative
I just called T-Mobile with complaints about my weak battery and told them talk time on the cell phone is 840min according to Amazon's specs for the T610 phone. T-mobile told me the talk time is 5 hours (300min). Who do you believe? I am tired of liars and money-gobbling b*st*rds!,Negative
"I got sick of xbox 360 microphones breaking, so I decided to buy this to see if it would work.Unfortunately it didn't work that well. I got sound and the microphone worked but I got a lot of feedback and echo. Worst of all it was supposed to block outside sound, but it didn't do this at all.I know that it was designed for xbox so I am not going to give it 1 star. I don't have a home phone so I haven't tried it for that.",Negative
"The earpiece is stamped ""Verizon"" and is of different finish than pictured. There was no packing slip enclosed but the USPS envelope in came in showed, ""ACCSTOP"" in Oxnard, CA. For $2.47, I guess it doesn't matter but still, not the item pictured.  It also came in a little plastic baggie - it was represented as new.Cannot try it as the 3.5mm adapter hasn't arrived from the other item in the earpiece set purchase.",Negative
"This phone is ugly and heavy and has a terrible user interface even for techies like myself.  It also drops calls like crazy here in Manhattan.  The Moto V600 is a much better phone, takes better pictures, gives you better clarity and reception, is smaller, and is much, much cheaper.  Get the Moto V600 if you want T-Mobile.  Stay away from this ugly monster.",Negative
"I gave this 3 stars because it does what it says, its nothing high end and doesn't promise miracles, but I won't give it 5 stars because simply there's a terrible delay from when my computer comes out of sleep mode and from the time it actually recognizes this hub on the com ports for the PC, on average its about 15 seconds.  So I'll be sitting there waiting to enter my password like an idiot until the hub is finally recognized by the PC.  And its a really good PC, brand new, no problems with USB 2 or USB 3 except where this hub is concerned.",Negative
I needed a second antennae for my Wilson Sleek cell booster so I could leave one with my vehicle and the other at my weekend residence for convenience. This antennae matched with the Sleek booster exceeded my expectations for strengthening a weak cell signals where I often find myself.,Negative
"This pad is extremely unreliable in that it does not stick to my dash and is very poorly made. One thing I will say is my wallet and phone have not fallen from the pad. Unfortunately, the pad moves all around.",Negative
"She used to keep her cell in the side door pocket and was always missing calls & messages, but problem solved.Has never fallen off.",Negative
"Since there is no rubber to ""gasket"" your ear, noisy environments can make it hard to hear. i.e. in you car.",Negative
"Don't purchase these if you plan to use in your car. The side walls are too thin and if this lays next to any 12 power source, my Sirus Radio in my case, you'll get the electrical whine as the cars rpm's increase and decrease. You get what you pay for.",Negative
Pros:- Price- Ease of pairing- Sound quality (yours and theirs)- Battery lifeCons- Painful for an extended time (10 mins)- Hard to tell if on or off,Negative
"I specifically ordered this headset because of the eye glass clip.  When I received the order, the clip would not fit on my glasses, and appeared to be of extreme poor contstruction (the type you would expect out of a Craker Jack box).The headset would required pressing the button to answer a call several times before it would actually pick up the call.The product is in the process of being returned to Amazon.com.",Negative
was very unhappy with this it didnt work no time i had got it for my husband and i haven heard the last of it from him,Negative
"I had a Samsung X427 before this and it was awful. Dropped calls, poor reception, wouldn't hold a charge. This phone changed my opinion completely. It does everything I need and then some, and the camera/video is a bonus. The only downside and the difference between 4 & 5 stars was that it did not behave well with my Jabra EarWrap-the remote button did not work-and the speakerphone is a joke. But speakerphone is not really what I needed, it was reliability and function.Really a far step forward-I recommend it for anyone needing a reliable phone.",Negative
Doesn't stay on even if you figure out how to get it on. The ear plug piece is big and bulky and then you can't hear. The mouth piece is way too short so no one can hear you talk over the car and road noise.  The cord is too short and there is not volume control on the cord with is inconvenient. Get the Bluetooth and give up the wire.,Negative
"Quality and value of this item are fine, but WHOA, it smells SO BAD!! Just like bug spray! I returned it promptly.",Negative
A little thick but protects well and the kickstand is stronger than other cases I've tried.The thicker corners also make it harder to slide into my car dock.,Negative
"its a worst product I have ever seen by motorola. It charges my phone but I have to hold the jack that goes into phone, and also have to drive at same time.I bought Belkin's similar product from Walmart for $10 and it rocks.",Negative
"I bought one of these and the second time I plugged it in the light on the end went out and it stopped working! This thing is junk, there is no way to replace the fuse (if there is one) without destroying it. I tried to take it apart, but you can't without breaking it. If this is a genuine motorola product its a stupid design. Now do I break it open and hope I can get it back together or toss it??? I have NEVER had a problem with a car charger in the 10+ years I have owned a cell phone, that should tell you something! How do you screw one up?! You hire the idiot who designed this one thats how!",Negative
"I like the small profile for this charger, but as with all the USB cable chargers I've tried it seems to charge somewhat slowly.  Trying to run the GPS navigation while charging it will still slowly drain the phone.  It seems the dedicated car chargers (with no USB port) seem to charger much faster.",Negative
The only thing I did not like about the charger is that only one of the plus is 2.1Amp the other is only one amp is unable to charge any of my devices. I will be looking for a stronger one.,Negative
This product looks bad with its odd structure however it performs very well and was a big hit with a colleague's trip to China. I plan to buy one for myself soon.,Negative
"I had a previous version of this product a few years ago. It lasted for about two year until a capacitor blew out. You could see it through the translucent case. I like the previous version. This one not so much.The AC prongs do not fold in so they are in the way when being used in a lighter outlet or stored in a pocket or computer back.It's larger than the combination of some separate ac only and 12v only chargers I have, so there is no space savings.When connected to my ipad or my razr maxx, the screen keyboard malfunctions. Spurious and random characters are generated when the screen is touched instead of the keys that should be detected. Unplugging the cable immediately stops this problem.I contacted BoxWave and they did send me a return shipping label. I have not gotten around to returning the charger yet. I dont know if this is a design issue or if I just got a bad unit. But the first two issues are reasons I would not recommend these even if the malfunction is just a bad unit.",Negative
"First time I bought this to pair up with my jabra a210 bluetooth adapter.  Worked fine, except that the vibrate feature won't work.  Then I exchanged it for another one.  This time the vibrate works, but the call pickup button would not work.  It works for power up/power down.  But I can't pickup any incoming calls.  The button simply wouldn't work for that functionality.  I tried it with few phones and it doesn't work.  I already exchanged the jabra adapter once.  Now I'm sick of exchanging it.  I think jabra has bad quality control.  Someone in the quality control shd be fired!  Everytime you exchange something, you run into a new problem.",Negative
"The range on the headset was pathetic - maybe 2 or 3 feet from the phone to get a decent signal (which defeats the entire puprpose of a CORDLESS headset IMHO).  Otherwise, it was horrific - static, terrible sound quality, etc.  Please do not waste money on that POS.  I swapped it out for the Moto H850 and am much happier with that unit paired up with my MotoE815.",Negative
"I'm not a Bluetooth techie, so I can't compare this to other headsets, but after a month of ownership, I can say it works great.My car has built-in Bluetooth, but everbody tells me that when I'm in the car it sounds like I'm under water.  Not so with the Motorola - I'm told it's crystal-clear.The only negatives I have are:* The multifunction button has no tactile feel - it leads you to press too hard, and too often.  This is especially a problem when you're walking or driving.* The flip out mic is nifty, but the headset tends to wobble if you shake your head at all.",Negative
"First, why so big?I like that the microphone turns the unit off/on but that is it.The ear piece has thin rubber around edge of speaker that eventually pealed off. Doesn't really impact comfort or help with cupping sound into ear so I'm not sure why that is there.The WORST part of this headset and the other 3 Motorola headsets I've had is that they take forever to activate during a call.  When my phone rings and I'm using my Samsung headset my call is picked up almost instantly, when using any of my Motorola headsets there is literally a 2-3 second pause after answering the phone until the headset is picked up.Often by the time my headset picks up people on the other end are already saying, ""Hello?  are you there?""I won't buy another Motorola headset, that's for sure.I gave it a 3 because I like the flip on/off & how it fits in my pocket because of that and that it does work.  It just doesn't compete with my Samsung or Plantronics headsets.",Negative
"Even though this ear piece is designed for a razor phone, the ear bud is too big, uncomfortable and it keeps falling off the ear. After two weeks of use, the on/off switch stopped working, and this feature was the main reason why I bought this unit. In sum, it was a waste of money. There was no provision in this review for ""0"" stars, so I gave it ""1""",Negative
"It worked for the small time we needed it. Didn't like the antenna, but hey the phone range and made calls. It had a calculator too!i know..big whoop!",Negative
"I tried two of these headsets and it was horrible for the person I was speaking to. Some heard the echo worse than the others, but all heard it. Some heard every word they said repeated back to them nearly as loud as my voice. Annoying to say the least and THANK YOU Amazon for being so amazing and taking both headsets back!",Negative
"couldn't be happier with this. and those who are embarrassed by its ""large"" size may want to consider being less insecure.",Negative
"Bought a few to have strategically placed around the house, cars, work, and in my briefcase and luggage packing so that I do not have to hunt for a cable.",Negative
i bought the wrong cable- which is my fault.  so sue me.  but don't actually sue me- i can't afford a lawyer.,Negative
"It is hard to write A review on a cable.  It works and does what it is supposed to do,",Negative
"Yea, basically. It's a phone charger for the Motorola Razor, and guess what? It works for it. Also works for a few other phones.",Negative
not sure what issue is here.  but I put one in my wifes BMW 335 Ci convertible and it makes a horrible background noise.  That was not there before.I put in my Buick Enclave and it works flawlessly.Not sure where the interference is coming from.,Negative
"This was used about four times before it stopped working, it was the car side with the issue and other chargers did work in this lighter so really not worth it.",Negative
Fits my Galaxy Note 3 but just doesn't want to stay on the window...keeps falling off.  Not much good if it keeps falling off.,Negative
"I'm on my third z520a in the six months I've owned it.  The only reason I haven't gone through more is that I've accepted this phone is a lemon.  The phone freezes and can't be shut off, requiring removal of the battery to reset, frequently drops calls, doesn't always let me place calls, and just plain does weird things that result in an unreliable and frustrating call experience.  What is even more annoying is that I purchased expensive, model-specific accessories that will become useless paperweights when I replace this with a new phone - a phone I will be out additional hundreds on, not to mention the cost of accessories.  I'll never buy another Sony Ericsson product.",Negative
"It lasted for less than a year and I always had trouble hearing people.  It never sat well on my ear, no matter how I adjusted it.  Luckily, it was less than $20, so no big loss.  I was disappointed because I expected better from Motorola. The volume control was awful. It never seemed to make much of a difference.  I wouldn't recommend it at all.",Negative
"While waiting for my order to arrive, I read a negative review about a terrible echo.  My advice to that reviewer - consider reading the instructions and adjust the mouth piece away from your mouth (not in the instructions).  Initially the headset hanging on one ear was a little uncomfortable, but within days I was walking out of the office forgetting I was even wearing it.  The range at the building I work is less than 100 feet, not a problem for my use.  Can't imagine not having the headset lifter or the flashing light accessory that clearly tells others when I am on the phone!",Negative
I got a defective purchase item here and am still awaiting the RMA from the seller.  Not really a comfortable product to wear.  Can't comment on the product as it has never worked to date. But I can say this was a bad buy in that the rig is not very comfortable to wear.  I can say look to other products to meet your needs.,Negative
"Pouch felt clumsy. There was extra play where the phone could wiggle around in. Also the clip is so thin that it's not good with sweatpants or scrubs. With the weight of the phone, it will flip over if it's not clipped onto a belt.",Negative
"this bluetooth headset is probably one of the worst you can ever waste money on.For some odd reason all of my motorola bluetooth, including this one has really really bad static.I cannot clearly hear the other person and the other person cannot hear me.I would save my money and buy a different brand altogether.Motorola H700 Bluetooth Headset",Negative
"I've fallen in the water kayaking a few times with my iPod Touch and LG Xenon in these cases.  They've been submerged in water for a few minutes and survived.  Haven't had any issues with humidity inside the pack, but I'm not a heavy user of my cell phone or Touch while paddling.",Negative
"This Data cable allowed me to access my Nokia 6085 (Black) phone's memory and Firmware update using Nokia Suite, It does what it is designed for.PROS:(+) CheapCONS:(-) May not last for multiple uses as the port connector on the cable may eventually break over time.Notes:(*) DO NOT use the Driver CD that comes with the product",Negative
"Though the Platntronics Voyager 510 works quite well, I was terribly disappointed with the accompanying carrying case which cost me an addtional $25! It's simply too small for the headset!",Negative
"I will be reluctantly getting my 3rd Q (replacement). I've only had this 2nd one for maybe 2 months. It would freeze constantly during the past 2 months forcing me to remove the battery for a restart. Now I have the dreaded Black Screen of Death with ""motorola flash mode bootloader version: boot_c_03.08.00R_MPAP"". Anytime bloggers start naming how your phone dies its a very bad sign!",Negative
"Overall this is a bad phone. The main reason I purchased it was because it's very thin and has no antenna. The reception is good and voices come in clear both ways. This is where the positives stop. The worst aspect of the phone is the poor battery life. I have even disabled EVDO so it won't switch between it and 1x when moving around town (which drains the battery).The Verizon software makes the phone useless. You cannot have the phone ring and vibrate at the same time, you cannot change the horrible wallpaper on the front LCD, and you cannot change the color scheme from red. Verizon has also disabled the use of Motorola Phone Tool, which enables you to put your own ringtones and media on the phone. You are forced to purchase media from the VCast service. Even if you wouldn't normally use media on your phone, you should object to this because of principal. It's corporate greed at its finest and Verizon is preventing you from using the full capabilities of your purchase.It does have a decent camera, but it's functionality is limited. It takes video clips, but nothing over 15 seconds. There are sites that tell you how to hack the phone, but it's not worth the time and risk of ruining the phone.The pluses: very thin, no antenna, sleek designCons: horrible user interface, very few options to change the appearance, many of the phone's functionality has been disabled by VerizonConclusion: buy something else. I succumbed to the hype of the Razr, but was burned. If it weren't for Verizon, the phone would be fine.",Negative
"This case is worthless with my Motorola HS815 headset.  Every time I put the headset in the case, the case squeezes the activation button on the headset.  Maybe it will work with headsets that do not have the activation button on the outside surface.",Negative
This bluetooth was my first and worst. I couldn't hear alot on it and it didn't stay on my ear for nothing. I would stay away.,Negative
"After a small amount of screwing around the H500 connected with myNokia N75 without a hitch.  I find that if you firmly place the earloop around the base of the ear and then fold in the receiver in fitsfirmly and doesn't come loose.  I agree that the volume could go higher;however, in a quiet room it is adequate.  I'm told that I'm clearlyheard on the other end of the connection.  This is also in a quiet room.Small and lite.  I think this a rather nifty piece of gear.",Negative
"Product came without shipping slip, no protective packaging. .Bluetooth was placed in a plastic bag, slipped in an envelope and mailed.  Quality is very poor.  Crackling, buzzing muffled sounds very annoying and diapointing to recieve something you are expecting to use all the time to not being able to use it.  I would not recomend this vendor to anyone.  Description stated very clearly that it would be packaged in retai packaged and pictured with extra items.  This came with bluetooth only and charge cord; no instruction or any other accessories with this.",Negative
"The sound is horrible in the car.  My fiancee said that it sounded like there were bubbling noises when I was talking to her via the headset.  So I called my home and left a message on my answering machine.  Horrible!  I could hardly hear myself over what sounded like bubbles in a fish tank.  Garbage.  Your mileage may vary, but I would highly recommend you consider a different headset.",Negative
"I am replacing this headset (It replaced an Explorer 320) with a 510 because I am sick and tired of swivel earhooks getting loose and falling off-which is apparently NOT a warranty issue according to Plantronics. Their recommendation? Replace the headset. I ordered my 510 tonight-can't wait to replace this one. Note-it drops calls frequently, which I know is a cell-phone company issue because it happens with the phone too. But the swivel earpieces are ridiculous. I could have bought a 520 for $2 more but chose not to because of the SWIVEL!",Negative
This product is junk. Had it less than a month and it stopped working. Dont waste your money.,Negative
When it arrived I went to plug it in and noticed one of the prongs was bent. I went to bend it back and it broke! Then I noticed rust at the base of the broken prong. I'm sending it back for a refund and won't be buying another one.,Negative
Do you have some money to waste? Buy this item. It is broken at 2nd day of use and does not stand phone. I rated 1 star because there is not less,Negative
"Thin materiel would not last long, inexpensive looking. Did not look anything like what I seen on the ad, returned item.",Negative
"As soon as I wrote and recommeded this product it broke, have not had it quite 3months, need a relacement already, understand what other customers concerns were now, could not stand the test of time!",Negative
"It looks really bad on the black S4 but i gave it to my friend with a white S4. So if you have the white one, buy it. If you don't, then dont.",Negative
The case is not as &34;slim&34; as advertised. It was hard to press the power button and the volume rocker. I had to use a knife to create some holes side of the case.,Negative
The case is a plain shiny black TPU material which fits snugly around the phone.  For the price it can't be beat!,Negative
"Ordered this to cover and protect my new SGS4. It covers the phone, but the holes for the mics dont line up centered over the holes and the buttons are nearly impossible to push (you really have to reef on them).",Negative
This case was okay... The rubbed edge is nifty but then the plastic was just thin and the kickstand is just poorly made... not to mention it's very hard to pull the kickstand out.,Negative
Don't buy this cheap ugly product! Worst mistake in buying a case for my phone. EEW! Never Again! NO! NO!,Negative
I didn't like this case to hard to put on the phone. I struggled wit getting it on. Imagine getting it off. Did not like,Negative
The only bad thing about this case it that the white discolored after a really short period of time.  It now looks more gray and dirty.,Negative
"I bought two, but they sent three; took 4 weeks to get in mail, as they'd warned when purchasing; wrapped up to look like OEM, but I'm thinking it's a fake; people selling it certainly haven't responded to my complaints;  works no longer than my 4 and 6 year old OEM batteries scavenged from other folks dead Moto V3 RAZRs.  Wish I could give them NO STARS on this one.",Negative
"I bought this battery several years ago for my RAZR V3, as the battery was about shot in it, and I shoulda just saved my money. This was not worth the time, effort or money. It wouldn't hold a charge for longer than an hour. Probably not a relevant review today, but still not worth your money",Negative
This was from 3 phones ago (at least).  But I remember it did the job well.  I had no problems with it.,Negative
"I had lost the CD for the previous Motorola Phone Tools and was unable to reinstall in  my Boot Camp partition.  So, I bought the ""Motorola Razr V3 Oem Original Usb Data Cable with Motorola Phone Tools 4.0 Software"" kit and threw away the cable (no razr here.)  At 49 cents you can't go wrong!  Now I've got the Moto Phone Tools installed on my new iMac.",Negative
Worst item I've ever purchased.  Brand new batteries wont' even fully charge my phone once.  Don't buy it.  The regular stores have stopped carrying it because it keeps getting returned because it doesn't work worth a darn.,Negative
"talking on it sounds like you are far away my phone customers say.  Very small, can be awkward to keep in ear",Negative
"Tried this speaker for a few weeks in my car but my wife and others complained they could not hear me over the background noise.  I tried eliminating or reducing the noise in my car (radio, A/C fan, ect) but nothing seemed to work even if the speaker was attached to the drivers' visor.",Negative
This is not a nice looking product but it does what it's supposed to do.  Lights up to let you know it's actually working or connected to a power source.  No complaints.  It is what it is.,Negative
"It kept my Motorola Krave out of my pocket where it couldn't be scratched by stray change and/or tools. The leather was supple and the felt-like lining protected the clear screen.And then one day, I struck my hip against a handrail and the clip broke off. :[",Negative
Poorly built phone holder.  The &34;arm&34; that moves was broken off when i opened the box due to the arm is only attached by the thinest piece of plastic.  Slight torque on the arm could easily break it off.,Negative
"When I pressed the release button, it expanded but would not fit the phone and lock anymore. I opened it and replace the faulty spring. It works now.",Negative
They said it was universal mount but it did not fit my Samsung Galaxy 3! I returned it and don't believe I ever received my credit.,Negative
I had trouble sticking both the silver plate and the black plate to my dashboard. They're just not strong enough and the magnet takes it right off the dash. I had to do some customization but eventually got the silver thin metal piece. I had to shape the thin silver plate into a taco and just clamped it onto something in my car so it would stay.,Negative
Terrible Unit. magnet not strong enough for Iphone 4s. Ended up buying a differnt model for 25 bucks that connects to your cd player slot and that one is amazing.,Negative
It is too tiny for holding a phone. The metal plate is also too tiny and thick to put between phone and case. Don't even bother to think about this product.,Negative
"The white turned blue in the pocket of my jeans, which I guess I should have expected, but it took less than a week.The volume buttons were covered, and made it difficult to push them.But, the case protected the phone, and the lip at the front helped protect the screen.",Negative
I bought these as in more than 1 thinking they would work on my home cordless phones and they did not as in you can hear the person on the other end but they cant hear you talk :(.,Negative
you get what you pay for .. the battery is years old .. but works.The shipment time was awful from the seller. They lost my shipment and had to resendthe order .. it arrived me after more than 20 days of waiting..,Negative
"I purchased these stereo bluetooth headphones for use with my Blackberry Curve 8900.These headphones work well indoors with no problems with connectivity, however the story is quite different when I am outside with the Blackberry in my pocket...the reception cuts in and out to the point where its unusable.  Holding the blackberry in my hand seems to improve the reception somewhat but that defeats the purpose.This is quite disappointing since I wanted to use these when I am out running so I am back to my wired headphones.  I am not sure if this is due to the Blackberry or the headphones itself.  There were some posts over in the Blackberry Forums that complain of this same problem.",Negative
I bought a couple of these for my father to keep on his car's dashboard. They stick well but do not break down in the sun and leave no sticky residue. They hold his phone and garage door opener with ease.,Negative
"I had my old Blackberry 8830 laying around with an unusable dead battery, so i ordered 2 identical replacements.  I received them and charged them fully and let the phone sit w/o usage overnight.  Next morning the battery was half dead already....To see a new battery lose half of its charge overnight is disappointing.  I don't suggest this battery at all even for $5 its was waste of time and money to deal with it.",Negative
don't change this product need extra just in case kinda hard on blue tooths jabra will not do you will not do you wrong,Negative
"I had very poor signal strength on my Verizon BlackBerry Tour phone when placed below and between the monitors in my cube.  The YX-300 solved this problem very well.Update: After about a year it died.  However, the cell coverage where I works seems to have improved, so I no longer need it.",Negative
"I ordered 3 of them, 2 of them came without an issue, but the 1 that had problem, it got very very difficult to get it replaced, the company I ordered from told me to go to Jabra directly, at Jabra website, after entering all the info as per requested, they simply send me an email to how to resolve it and after trying that and notify them again via email (no phone ), and I've asked for an exchange and again, they replied to ask me to do the same process again, it's never ending. Bad customer service.",Negative
"This perform as advertised.  You plug it in, push a few buttons and it'll tell you how much juice the device(s) are sucking up.  Whether it's a single item or a surge suppressor, it'll tell you all the consumption details you need.  Plug in the cost per kWh and you've got the total cost per the elapsed time.  Calculations are there if needed as well to calculate day, month costs.As other reviews had mentioned the small text is hard to read without proper lighting and angle.  You can get used to the pattern so there would be no need to look at the small text once you get used to it.",Negative
"This product makes it very easy to calculate the energy usage on all 110 volt appliances-- from lamps, DVD players to refrigerators and coffee makers. You just plug it into the appliance and then read the daily, weekly, monthly, or annual energy cost-- almost idiot proof. Just be prepared to be shocked about your considerable energy needs. We are preparing to buy a new refrigerator to replace our 20 year-old model based on the reading this device gave.",Negative
I tried two of them. Both would not hold a charge. I hated the charger. It has to be in the case to charge. The company I ordered from said &34;new&34; but it was clearly not in both instances. I'm still searching for an &34;in ear&34; model that works.,Negative
"I must have read more than 30% of the reviews on Amazon about the product. Nonetheless I decided to ignore the iphone 4 users that complained about not working and thus relaying on the product description. Alas, that was an awful choice. After connecting it and displaying the charging symbol about 2 minutes later it warned me the device does not support charging. I tried 3 more times and every time it kept dropping so I decided to leave it as such, even worse the battery seemed to have turned hot. It does charge other usb devices but it failed to deliver the purpose of its purchase: charge my iPhone 4.",Negative
I wish i can give this a negative star!!! the day it came i plugged it in the car and to my phone and it worked great for a few min. i then unplugged it and threw it in the glove box for a few days and when i when i go to use it - it no longer worked after a few days of sitting in my glove box. terrible.,Negative
"I had a 1.0A USB charger and this thing was just crap. After looking at the reviews, I took a chance on this charger and it seems to do that job very well. It charges up very quickly and one up! I even purchased two of these bad boys.",Negative
Not much to say here. It fully powers my Nexus 7 when using Bluetooth and navigation. Other adapters do not have the juice to run Bluetooth and navigation without also draining the battery slowly.,Negative
"What else can you say; An OEM unit that is specifically geared towards its sister products, the Motorola Droids.Performs as excellently as expected!!!",Negative
"Works well, does exactly what it's supposed to do.Works with any device that requires a micro usb charger.When purchasing a charging device, you always want to use one that meets all oem specifications to avoid any damage to your phone.You can't go wrong with Motorola.",Negative
"Now after not four months its trash, does not charge any longer.  I contacted seller and they said, sorry you had a 30 day window to send back. Ever hear of a 30 day warranty? Garbage. Guess you get what you pay for.",Negative
My friend use the one in my truck and wanted to take it with him all the time So I ordered one for him his phone is going dead all the time,Negative
"Unlike some other chargers I can be using the nav feature, talking on the phone, and the battery charge still goes up on my Droid X.",Negative
I purchased this one after being fooled into buying a Verizon knockoff charger. This is the real deal; Motorola brand. There's nothing wrong with it and it always chargers my phone.,Negative
"I love that I can plus this charger in and still use my phone.  I hate those chargers that freeze up once its plugged in, but this is not the case with this charger.  I would purchase another in a heartbeat if the one i have ever breaks",Negative
"Worked for 1 yr ... then the micro usb connection wore out and became loose.The wearing out of the micro USB connection appears to be very common among cable manufactures.The price is so low though that I did purchase another one just now.If the connection is loose, I will return it.And yes ... I ordered the one from Amazon.",Negative
"I'm disappointed as the title said ""rapid"" charger and its definitely not that. I use my Samsung Galaxy S III in the car for navigation (duh). I was hoping keeping it plugged to this charger will, at the very least, MAINTAIN the level of charge that I had when I got into the car, even if not charge it up fully as I drive. No such luck. My charge kept going down. I had to switch the screen off so the charger could charge the phone up  a bit so it wouldn't go completely dead.",Negative
"Having tried many 1 and 2 amp chargers from Scosche and been disappointed (my android used to discharge using navigation and Pandora), I decided to try this.It works!!!! Phone charges with everything on!",Negative
"Nothing compares for the price . If it fails ,throw it, order another . Still ahead in $$$ ,compared to the pricey ones.",Negative
I don't know when the person received their order who said that the product didn't have split rings but I received mine in Aug. 2013 and they did have split rings.  I've just received them so I don't know how they will hold up but they look the same as any other product of this type.  My only complaint is that they came from China and it took two weeks for delivery.,Negative
"You can't beat the price.These are much smaller than I was expecting.  But still do the job.If you are looking for a bigger, thicker cord...don't get these.  The cords are very thin and they are quite short.  But if that is what you are looking for, then these are for you.",Negative
They shipped from China and took forever to get here. They're not easy to put into use without distorting the clasp a bit. They come in a 10 pack so pay attention because I didn't and order 30 instead of the 3 I thought I was purchasing. Oh well guess i have a life times supply.,Negative
"I hate the fact I wasted money on this product. After 2 days I had 1 hour of battery life. I had to keep it on charger just to have juice for maybe 1 conversation, its not comfortable, and its flimsy. Dont waste your money.",Negative
Not worth spending money on this guy ! Not worth spending time on this guy either !Not worth spending money on this guy ! Not worth spending time on this guy either !,Negative
"I chose this card even though it had mediocre reviews because it was the only one I could find that charged by use, not a prepaid amount.  I went to europe and never used the card/phone and was charged for 3 text messages that I never got.  For $2.40 I didn't fight the error very hard but the fact remains I was charged for services not rendered.  Further, they were were after me for the $2.40 before I even got back from the 8 day trip.  (emails when I got home were already in my inbox)  Its not the money, its the principle, I don't like disingenuous companies.  For a lousy $2.40 they should have just said sorry and written it off.  I would have used the card on future trips but its in the trash now.",Negative
"I bought the card and took it on an international trip.  I put the card into my phoneand went to the site to activate it, and it said to put in 19-20 numbers, but therewere about 30 numbers and letters on the sim card.  It was worthless.",Negative
"4 stars because the quality is fairly cheesy... but hey, at a buck who can agrue?  I got a few of them since they were a dollar and they still work well.  2 months in.",Negative
"The micro USB side of the cable could never establish a reliable connection with any device I attached it to, and this past week it stopped working all together. I've owned this item for well under a year; way too soon for a cable to stop working.I advise looking at a different company.",Negative
"I've tweaked mine and added 3rd party programs, but you can't get around the fact that it's pretty darn hard to make a simple phone call without the stylus, and it's especially frustrating to use the keypad for call options (e.g. voice mail) once your call is connected.  This just plain sucks.Basic phone call operations turn into a two handed procedure, pretty dangerous when you're on the road.After 5 months with this phone, I'm really missing a phone that has a keypad.  I've gone back to my Nokia 73 and will continue shopping for a better Windows Mobile device...",Negative
Kept this in my car and it worked well for 2 or 3 uses then just stopped working. Replacement cable worked well so wasn't my car. Not happy with the quality of this product.,Negative
"This ear piece have a weak reception ,it don't filter out sounds very well,this is a very poor product disappointed.",Negative
This bluetooth is NOT woth buying. It hurts your ear so bad that you will have to take it out often. The voice quality is NOT good and the person voice drops out often. The battery is also very bad. It does NOT last long at all even on a full charge. I will never buy another Motorola bluetooth again!,Negative
THIS IS MY 4TH UNIT IN THE PAST 3 YEARS. I GUESS I WEAR THEM OUT AS I AM ON THEM 12 HOURS A DAY.,Negative
"Didn't work for connecting a card reader to a smart phone. It was useless, but the price was so low at $1.76, so it was not worth the try to the post office.",Negative
"Shipping service is terrible.  Don't expect to receive your order for at least 2 weeks.  Product feels cheaply made, like the wire will snap at any moment, and above all, it does not work if you need all 4 channels.",Negative
"Needed for a gen 1 iPhone because of the silly reassessed headphone jack. This solved the problem, but I still feel like I shouldn't need it.",Negative
"Another bad part of the iphone is regular headphones just don't fit.This fixes that, and is flexible so it doesn't get screwed up bouncing around in my pocket.  A+++, would buy again.",Negative
"Very nice design. I like the style and controls. However, the headset that comes with the unit is bad. The ear pieces will not stay in the ear. But because of the design, any ear buds can be used in place of the supplied ones. The only other issue I have is the unit keeps cutting in and out. That said I would still purchase a replacement unit if something happens to this one.",Negative
It doesn't cost that much so thats a pro.  But it fails at it's main purpose--Consistently charging the iphone 3G--. It was very haphazard.  Sometimes it worked and sometimes it didn't.  And finally it just stopped working.,Negative
"these are intermittent, dont waste your time on the aftermarket products they just dont last, not worth the hassle of wondering if it will work",Negative
"The connection is bad and many times when I talk I can hear myself again, which means it echos like crazy and its not worth it to get something that will not work",Negative
"This is what the Dr. ordered. No need looking any further. It's bulky but, un-stylish vs buying a new phone cause it was not protected. Give me the ugly.",Negative
"I am not sure how somebody can screw up a simple audio cable extender cable, but these guys have done it. It is impossible to create a solid connection both inside the iPhone and when connecting the headphone jack. Once everything is snuggly plugged in, the slightest rotation/jerk of the cable in the iphone produces hiss and loss of contact. Same goes for the headphone jack. It's like these things are made not to maintain a continuous contact where they're supposed to have a contact. Avoid at all costs.",Negative
I use this to get through an otterbox on my iphone.  Buy this one instead of the ELONGPRO (elongpro is finicky and loses one channel if not perfectly aligned).  I would buy this one again.,Negative
"I'm not sure how long this worked for...my girlfriend noticed that when she pushed the connection slightly, the bass would suddenly get richer....tested on a Nano and an iPhone 4S. Disappointing but it's a super-cheap cable so....I missed the Amazon claim window by 2 weeks but Eforcity only covers this for 30 days. Where other companies would send out a replacement, no questions asked, this company does not. Buyer beware.NOTE: the connector did fit into the iPhone even with the case on, which was why I purchased it to begin with.",Negative
"The unit works boosting weak cell phone signals.If you are in a area with a fairly strong signal, the data rate seemed to be slower when using the booster. I would attribute this to the inherent signal delay introduced by the booster - which probably does not affect voice calls, so don't expect higher data rates when using the booster with a data card. On the other hand, when using a data card where the external signal is VERY weak, the data card was unable to keep a reliable data connection, but the signal was still usable for a voice connection.",Negative
"It works just fine. It's kinda awkward to get the iPhone in and out, especially because you have to unplug the headphones, and you can't really touch the screen, so you have to get the iPhone out, which as I said before is awkward. But if you just want it stuck on your arm, it works!",Negative
"Its a armband for the iphone, I am really small so I put it around my leg. It gets the job done!!",Negative
I have gone thru a lot of windshield holders for phones/GPS and this was not what I expected. I am rough with my things and this product I had to be careful when I connected my phone.,Negative
"This item was recommended as a piggyback purchase when I purchased a Plantronics Voyager Pro+ bluetooth headset.  It was advertised as a desktop charging stand for the headset.  Apparently, it's a base for the Voyager 510 charger (the old, first Voyager that Plantronics introduced, which I owned light-years ago in technology time).  The Pro+ fits awkwardly in it (tight fit) and the base does not come with a charger (although the picture shows a cord attached to it).  It's just a desktop weight and the Voyager Pro+'s charger does not fit.  When you jam it in there, the base does not sit flat and rolls around on the desk.  It does not stand vertically.  In sum, it's a rather expensive paperweight that advertises Plantronics.  Thanks for nothing and i hope it helps some of you save your money.",Negative
"This product is a bad joke!  It isn't a charging stand at all!  It is simply a plastic disc that is ""supposed"" to fit and hold the earpiece.  I can't make it function as described and I am a mechanical engineer!  It did not come with any instructions at all.  It arrived in a simple clear plastic bad with nothing else.  I rate this at as a total waste of my money!",Negative
Works for the Blackberry Storm and any other device that uses a micro USB port.,Negative
Mine lasted 4 days before the screen quit.  There is a reason these are sold with no warranty!  I wasted $40 on one.,Negative
"I used this once. Now it doesnt see the charger unless I push it in hard - and when I do, or use a different charger, it never charges. Now its for the landfill.",Negative
"I purchased the iTorch IMP52D for my week-long trip to SXSW. Without this device, my smartphone would have been dead by 10am. I kept the iTorch in my pocket and hooked up my phone anytime the battery level dropped below 20% and disconnected the phone when the batter was over 90%. I fully re-charged my battery at least 3 times each day.Over the week the iTorch did not let me down. I don't recommend going to a conference without it!",Negative
"Well, you get what you pay for, sometimes. I wanted to believe this adapter was going to solve my headphone jack problems, but alas, ten minutes into my workout it had fallen completely apart and the wires had detached.",Negative

"Given as a gift to someone who had reception problems at home. I set it up and no more needed to be done, it has worked for them very well. Limited coverage in the house is the only issue, but they can make calls from the house now, which was impossible before.",Negative
"There are two stickers, one on the the protective screen and one on the backing. These stickers are used to separate the protective screen from the backing.  Unfortunately the sticker attached to the actual screen would not peel off. This leaves the screen protector unusable. There were three screen protectors and they all had the same problem.",Negative
"The cable charged my phone. We are very hard on cables and I think we used this one for a few months before losing it, so I would definitely recommend.",Negative
Just like the one I received with my iphone. Like having a back up as my son loses things like this. Would definately recommend!,Negative
I bought 2 of these and they both stopped working within about a month. I didn't spend a lot of money but obviously something is wrong with them.,Negative
"These cables did not do the trick for me. They lasted a week or so, and immediately started to fall apart botha t the base o the wire, and at the metal part. The wire also started to rupture after a few weeks.",Negative
All I need to say is that the price an the fact that it works is enough for me...Can't go wrong!,Negative
"Works just as well as the expensive Apple ones. You can tell they are a little cheaper as the end plastic covers tend to fall off, but nothing a little glue can't handle. Or, just pick up a few since they are so cheap!",Negative
You got what you pay for. Got the inexpensive wires to fin that will not work with my IPad 2. I use it for other devices but did not work for what I purchased for.,Negative
"Its made a little wider than the Apple one. The Apple one fits into the slot on my bumper but this one is too wide, so I had to cut off some of the plastic with a knife.",Negative
The materials and design are not nearly as durable as the ones that come with your phone. These are delicate and easily broken. I ordered 2 and 1 didn't work at all.,Negative
"cord should be at least 1 m long, not 12&34;. even a good price doesnt save this bad product. and when you call the company -it's &34;oh we're sorry - it's out of stock - thats why we sent the short ones.&34;",Negative
"I waited almost 2 months for this product and when I finally got it, it didn't even work. The worst dollar ever spent. :(",Negative
"I rarely used it to begin with, but now it just won't even charge or work at all.  It's very frustrating.",Negative
Charges up my Iphod (iphone i use as an ipod since i wouldnt be caught dead with an iphone as my phone),Negative
I can't tell the difference between this cable and te one that came with my iPhone. And for only a buck you can't go wrong. I highly recommend this.,Negative

"Bought two USB cables.  Thought I'd give it a whirl.  Took a while to receive them, turns out neither of them work...Don't waste your time and money.",Negative
Don't even work I hate this product it stop workin after 10mins ill never buy from this company again worst money spent its dont cost a lot for a good reason cause it beyond cheap,Negative
"Broke 2 months after using due to pulling from the cord, not from the plug head. BIG LESSON THERE. the cord will separate rendering the cord useless.",Negative
It.s hard to rate it because I have not got it yet and I do not know what the hangup is I payed my bill but no cable yet.,Negative
"cheep is cheep, if you're gonna get this put  tape around the either end to help reinforce the weak spots at either end and DO NOT pull n the cord itself to disconnect.",Negative
After a few weeks it started acting up for some odd reason and I really don't know why! Its frustrating too!,Negative
"The apple charger surely is poor quality. Last time i wrote a review about how bad it is & it broke when i used it. But the owner is not. After my last review the seller (YOU) called me, i got the voicemail but then i don't want a refund because it's only $1 & i don't have time to put the mail and stuff together. Few days later i got a new one, without asking. Thanks for being a trustful seller.",Negative
"I'm not sure why this is called a charging cable, it does not work as such. We didn't get it for about 8 weeks after ordering and ended up getting a refund, but it didn't matter about the money, the wait time was frustrating (we obviously ordered it for a reason, we needed it). After all that waiting it didn't work. Don't waste your time or your dollar.",Negative
"It doesn't pass power or signal through to my iPhone 4S. The Apple store folks told me today that it's not approved for the 4S, and that there is nothing that they could do. (I've had trouble with all non-Apple-manufactured iPhone 4S and 5S cords.) I'm wondering if this is even returnable. I MIGHT just have received a defective part.",Negative
Bought it then it stopp working. Didn't have it for long. Kinda disappointed so just ought one from the apple store,Negative
Broke instantly! Not worth my money! I'm tired of waisting my money on these! Nothing like the original! :( :(,Negative
"THIS CHARGER WAS HORRIBLE, THE WIRES STARTED SHOWING AFTER 1 DAY AND SOMETIMES I HAVE TO PLUG AND UNPLUG MY IPHONE MULTIPLE TIMES BECAUSE I GET A MESSAGE THAT SAYS THIS ITEM IS NOT SUPPOBY IPHONE. ITS EXTREMEMLY FRUSTRATING BECAUSE ITS ALREADY FALLING AND APAAND BARELY CHARGES MY PHONE. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND BUYING.",Negative
This is very inexpensive cable for the iPod/iPhone. It is identical in looks. It came in a smallish pouch with no box or any literature at all. I already tried it and it works by charging my iPhone (I have a 3GS with an Otterbox case).  Are there any issues?  It is very difficult to remove.  This is the cable that you just pull to disengage not the older cable that has a bigger end (not the one that has buttons on each side that you need to pinch before can pull it off).  It is very hard to remove that is actually scary I might damage the connector of my iPhone.,Negative
"IT works for charging any apple device but when it comes to syncing any data, that can be difficult. Since it is generic it tends not to want to sync data sometimes.",Negative
This item is not even worth your time... Please take my advice and keep scrolling pass this or you will be disappointed for purchasing.,Negative
"it is tight for i phone. u have to push hard and pull hard. I stopped using, may damage i phone pins. Dont want to risk $599 to save $7",Negative
This is a piece of junk do not waste your time or money. Not sure how they got away with selling this garbage!,Negative
These just do not last long.although it arrived on time once we used it it didnt take long to discover how bad it sucked.I would NEVER order these again!,Negative
"IT IS VERY BAD AND DIDN'T LAST A LONG TIME WHICH SHOCK ME BECAUSE OF AN APPLE PRODUCT,VERY DISSAPPOINTED OK",Negative
"My iPhone cable needed to be replaced because the wires were exposed. I noticed it starting to come apart a few days ago and decided to order this one. I was relieved when I received it today because this cable really should be thrown out and replaced. I'm afraid of a fire or something. When I plugged it in, I was very disappointed to find that it didn't charge my phone. I tried a different outlet and then I tried the USB port on my laptop. Nothing worked. Sending it back to Amazon but have to find one at a store so I can continue charging my phone.",Negative
"Every iphone connector seems to break or the wires will comeout within a month or two and i'll have to buy another one for like $5 or less, they all suck.",Negative
"I purchased this cable through Nathan Norris. Please, please please save yourself the money and DO NOT buy this cable. Mine stopped working after having it just a little over a month. Unfortunately, I'm now outside the timeframe for returns and I'm stuck with a USB cable that's completely useless.Save your money, don't buy!",Negative
These are inexpensive and barely work. I was attracted by the price but they are tough to make function with my kids phones.,Negative
connections poor and tight fit. hard to connect and disconnect. sometimes it works to play music from iphone and others it does not. will always charge it. never have this problem with other wires.  would not buy this again.,Negative
i guess it worked fine but whenever I connect it to my computer it says &34;device not compatible&34; or something like that. I should probably buy one at Target although they're really expensive :(,Negative
"Something went wrong with my earpiece after maybe 6 months if that. The charger wouldn't charge it anymore. I tried changing chargers, cords and outlets and nothing would work. Neither would the little charging case that came with it. So, now I'm in the hole after an expensive purchase let me down.",Negative
I use these 925 earpieces every day. I buy them five at a time because I either lose them or they die after a while. I hate holding a cellphone up to my head...and I don't have to with these little gems.I tried a newer version and it picked up a lot more wind noise.,Negative
"I bought this to match my car, however as soon as it was out of the warranty from amazon, it broke. I had to contact the manufacturer and it was going to cost me over twenty dollars to send it to them and then I had to wait 6-8 weeks for it to return or one that is of the same value. Which they could not guaranty would be gold. So, I have it here somewhere for me to look at occasionally :(",Negative
"I originally bought this cable to transfer files between a LG shine and a computer because my mother's LG Shine phone screen had broken and she unfortunately didnt save any of her photos on a micro SD card. Unfortunately i couldnt get the computer to recognize the phone so i was out of luck...it didnt work for what i intended to use it for...but it does work...so only 4 stars because it works, just not the way i want it to and it arrived 2 days after the delivery date",Negative
RECIEVED ON TIME BACK COVER WAS BROKEN ASKED FOR ANOTHER ONE AND THEY SENT ME A PINK COVER SERIOUSLY WTH THE THE HONE IT SELF STOP WORKING WITHIN A FEW WEEKS HORRIBLE DONT WWASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME ITH THESE PEOPLE VERY UNPROFESSIONAL.,Negative
"If you check my reviews on Amazon.com, I have hundreds.  Not ONE of them, despite my traumatic experiences with a few, have ever received one star.That's changing today.I just received the stylus and was stoked to try it on Sketchbook Mobile.  As soon as I turned on my iPhone I though, ""What the heck; let's try it on the menu screen to navigate to the app.""  I pushed the stylus gently, and nothing work.  I pushed a little harder, and that seemed to get the iPhone working.  I opened Sketchbook, but nothing happened.  I pressed harder, and still nothing.  I then pushed even harder and tried to draw, and the stupid stylus scratched my screen.  It's a little nick on my screen protector, so I'm not too worried.I did read that you have to push harder to get it working if you have a screen protector, but I pushed all the way and no result was shown.I'm returning the stylus a.s.a.p. to Amazon.com.My guess is that this will be my only one-star review--ever.  I read the others precautionary reviews, but thought I was the exception.I was wrong.",Negative
This product is not pretty but it works and you don't get a lot of oil on the screen protector from your fingers.  It will snap over an Elago slim case.,Negative
Do not buy.  Threw ours away.  It overheats when plugged in to the point where it is hard to touch it.,Negative
I bought 4 of these because they are cheep and my girlfriend tends to destroy the wire by yanking on it.  The only issue I have with these specific chargers vs ones that I got in the past is that they don't seem to be held together as well so I'm a little worried they will actually fall apart before she breaks them.,Negative
"I've purchesed the S9 from Volume Cellular and received the item as promissed. in few days of usage, the device started to have problems with the controlls. within a week, the device was DEAD! I contacted the seller, and advised of the situation, the seller was very helpful in providing assistance, and options including refund. Even I had encountered some problem when returning the device through UPS, the seller promply refunded my money upon receival.  As I stated earlyer, Greater service, bad product from motorola!! Maybe just my bad luck on this device.  Well buy again from the seller, just not another S9 head set.",Negative
"Awful product!  When I first received it, the Skip/Back function did not work, and I could not skip tracks from the headset as advertised.  The volume was very low, even at maximum device and headseat volume levels.  If the headset was exposed to even a little moisture, it either: randomly increased or decreased the volume (with an insane ""beep"" every 1/2 second) or stopped functioning altogether.  This made the headphones useless for jogging/workouts or yard work - even a little bit of sweat screwed it up.  The rubber ear pieces fell off after the third use.  Finally, the range is horrible - unit cut out constantly while my cell phone was in its holster on my waist.  I had to wear an arm holster so the unit would be in range.  When I compare this 2 foot range to the 40+ foot range of another Bluetooth device, these headphones don't measure up.  I suppose it would be suitable for sleeping with your phone next to you on the bedstand (and you do not sweat while you sleep!)...  Thank goodness it was only $50 on here instead of the $100 they were asking at retail stores.",Negative
There is not much to say about this other than it is what they say it is and it worked and got here on time. thank you,Negative
"Converts mini- to micro-USB, keeping your phone charger out of the landfill for just a little longer. Period, the end.",Negative
Been they where from Motorola I assumed they would be reliable. After a while they don't fit we'll in the mini port side and won't charge unless you hold it in place . Kinda of disappointed,Negative
"Don't waste your money on these because if they do work when u get them, they will quickly break and/or mess up your phone if u try to use it while it's plugged in. It doesn't work at all if u try to use it with your computer to transfer data like photos, etc. I'm very disappointed b/c I purchased 4 of these since we went from cell phones having the micro usb charger to the mini usb chargers & it seemed like such a waste to throw our old cords away. I knew i was taking a risk after looking at some of the reviews, but i decided to chance it & struck out. My advice is not to even gamble on it working.",Negative
This does what it's supposed to do. Convert a mini USB to micro USB. I use it on my Motorola phone and it works just fine.I appreciate the little loop adapter they included because I don't have to go around looking in my bag for it since it's attached to the mini-USB.,Negative
"I used this product for a little while.  let my girlfriend (at that time) borrowed it, and that was the last time i saw it.  =(",Negative
"the tip is waaaaay too big for what i was wanting.. not sure what this would be needed for, i got for a phone, maybe a tablet?",Negative
"Gave it only three stars initially for very confusing instructions on how to pair this device with TL86109!  I was about ready to pack this up and return it thinking it was not compatible with TL86109.  The instructions in the guide for the TL7600 do not work for for the 86109.  You must go to Page 133 of the manual for the 86109 to pair it. Luckily I saved the manual for the phone which I bought 3 Years ago!(Very simple if you don't still have the manual---you just press down the HOLD button on the telephone base. It will then say REGISTERING HANDSET)After following the instructions, it still wouldn't pair. It would say REGISTERING HEADSET for about 45 seconds, then beep and return to homescreen.  I removed the battery and unplugged the charger, then plugged everything back in, placed headset in charger and tried it again. (NOTE--I think it has to be on the charger base to pair)  PRESTO!  Headset registered after 3 seconds.  I haven't used it much yet, will update review after using for a bit.",Negative
This second unit has a crooked band around the neck and it does not fit the ear well.  I did not use it and it is too late to return a defective product that came to me like that.,Negative
Bought this item as part of a package and I must say it's a bit weird and takes a long time to charge batteries. Wouldn't recommend buying it. Invest in other type of chargers here.,Negative
"It is quite universal for cell phone batteries.  It has a low output, so it is slow to charge up a battery.",Negative
"this  is product is a little weak, but if you handle it carefully all goes well. thanks for  the product",Negative
"Really for the price you can't beat this cover. It is thin and only slightly adds to the bulk of the phone, and gives a little secutity buffer if your expensive new toy gets dropped.",Negative
"Aliph Jawbone II is a farce. I tested it by calling several people and nobody can hear me well. They all said I sounded very far away, even though the volume was at it's maximum. The fit is not comfortable at all. I tried every single earbud and earloop. If the VAS button can't make contact with your face, the unit is useless. As you have to press it against your face (face too skinny?), what is the point of wearing a headset if you need to use one hand to operate it and the other hand on the steering wheel? This is not safe IMHO.",Negative
This paired ok but both talk modes people had trouble hearing me and the quality of the conversation was very poor. this is not a good head set!,Negative
"I live an a weak signal area for AT&T.  Before using the Cell Ranger I could not get a signal in my yard.  Not, depending on my location in the yard or driveway, I can get 3-4 bars!  I usually have to be less than 4 feet from the Cell Ranger though, like sitting in my car or truck with the Cell Ranger plugged in.",Negative
Horrible device - I had purchased 3 of these from various sources - one from Amazon - guess what  2 of the three have broken - one at the joint behind the holder - and one of the devices jaws came open while driving dropping my expensive device.Just a poor buying and using experience.,Negative
"The little lever to push in, which adjusts the width, only does its job about 1/3 of the time. The other times I just push it in vain.",Negative
"I guess its a crap shoot when you buy cheap, but since a Lot of the reviews were positive I decided to give it a try. Unfortunately the&34;Spring loaded locking mechanism&34;  did not work on this one, making it effectively useless",Negative
Unless you hit the sweet spot in installation the holder fits awkwardly and doesn't feel sturdy. I would recommend going with an air vent mount or a CD slot mount.,Negative
"...as I recall.  It was a bit slippery.  But functioned well, and saved my phone from damage on a few drops.",Negative
"I've had this case for over 6 months now and it's been a life saver.  The extra cushion on the corners has saved my iPhone 3g multiple times.  And we're talking a fall from the kitchen counter to a tile floor.  Definitely protects the phone.The belt clip is pretty much worthless.  The prongs that hold the case extend out and catch on just about everything that I brush past.  So I've stopped using the belt clip.  So if you need a phone case with a belt clip, don't get this one.",Negative
This is junk. I have never had one sound so bad. It doesn't even hold a charge for very long,Negative
iBought Invisible shield for the back of my iPhone 3G.  I studied all of the installation videos and instructions. Invisible Shield is impossible to apply properly. It sticks to itself when peeling it off the backing. The edges do not apply properly around the corners of iPhone 3G. The part of the film that does apply to the back of iPhone looks nasty.  At least Zagg accepted my return and credited the charge on the money-back guarantee.,Negative
"This bluetooth headset has now replaced my normal one. My car has terrible road noise. When using my Motorola flip bluetooth headset, people always complain. I have now started using this headset not only for SOCOM, but also everyday with my Blackberry for in car use. It's a steal deal with SOCOM.",Negative
"Unnecessary equipment for Ipod touch 2g, unless your fingers are gigantic. Then maybe you might need this. I gave mine away.",Negative
This thing won't slide on the screen at all. It's as though it were actually designed to grip the screen like a race car tire. Absolutely worthless for handwriting and almost impossible to use for drawing. All you can do is tap with it.It's not even worth $1. Just spend $10 on a real stylus that actually slides on the screen with minimal friction.,Negative
"They can be used to scroll up and down lists, but when you try to type with these stylus', they won't work.",Negative
"Just generic made. Does it's job, but is bad quality. Will bend or ends will fall off. 3 stars for that",Negative
This instrument makes writing easier on the iPhone. I had trouble writing because my fingers are too thick. I had difficulty picking the letters on the digital key board but now it's resolved.,Negative
"The product is well made, but does not work with iPhone. You can type if you press really hard.  But you can no navigate or flick the screen.  Therefore, it doesn't work.",Negative
"The case came a few days earlier than the listed anticipated arrival date and I couldn't be happier. The case fits around the iPhone 5's body like a glove. I was afraid I'd drop the drive soon after purchasing it, but after seeing this case, I instantly fell in love--especially with such a low price!",Negative
"This base looks great, is very solid, and works exactly as expected. The recharger that comes with BlackBerry plugs into the back of this cradle and charges through two connectors on the back of the BlackBerry, so this will not work with most ""skin"" type cases.I like that the BlackBerry screen is visible when it is in the cradle so I can see my email and phone calls.  Due to the weight and the rubberized base this is a very stable base, which allows you to still use the BlackBerry when seated in the base.Highly Recommended!CFH",Negative
"It protects the iPhone screen but I find it hard to install without creating bubbles under it. If there is any dust particles got under the screen when you put it on, you will get bubbles.It does not last very long, it looks like I may have to get another one soon.",Negative
"the case is sleek to the touch and the eye, it has just the right amount of space to phone the phone tightly without it being bound so much it difficult to pull out when you're in a hurry",Negative
"This case does not fit Blackberry storm, although the seller claims it does.The case is too small for storm with Silicone skin and too big for naked storm (the phone bangs side to side).",Negative
I bought this case because I wanted to purchase a sturdy reliable case for my iPhones 3gs. This case is terrible. It not only lets in dust and dirt that will scratch the back of your phone over time the 2 parts that allow the case to fit together always come apart. The plastic that the case is made from is also very brittle. it eventually begins to chip away over time thus leaving areas of your phone exposed. It's a terrible case and a waste of money!,Negative
bought 2 of these - 1 broke putting in on the phone. the other will not stay together.  Look elsewhere for a case.,Negative
"My wife this case for a year, from when she had the iPhone 3G till the 4 came out. Absolutely no issues with it!",Negative
"Two things make me recommend NOT buying this case:1. The bump in the back that is apparently supposed to hold the two halves together: what it ends up doing is tilting the phone backwards slightly whenever you put it down, which makes it that much harder to see the screen. (It also doesn't hold the two halves together).2. Every time I attach headphones, the case slides up and I have to reattach it. This is beyond annoying.Another note: Because this case is listed separately for each color, my bad review is only going to show up under pink unless I copy it to the other colors. There is NO difference between the various colors, and one review would apply to them all.",Negative
"After just 2 days of normal use, the blue paint begins to peel off! Silver-metal material is showing. It looks ugly! I would never buy it again.",Negative
"I guess you get what you pay for... the Plastic does not work well with the touch screen.. now that really sucks... I tried cutting it out... afraid the iphone might come out....  So, I'm back to just holding while running...",Negative
No more lost headsets on the airplane for me. I hate when my headset falls off when i travel and I lose it in the rush to get all my crap off the plane. the lanyard that plugs into the usb slot and I always have it on my neck. A cheap solution when compared to replacing expensive earbud headsets. I use this on any usb headset.,Negative
"My wife has a very small Bluetooth headset and tends to misplace it often. This lanyard has corrected the problem ... since getting the lanyard, she hasn't enlisted me once to find her headset. (She did ask for help once when she couldn't find the lanyard, what are you going to do?)",Negative
"First let me say I like it, but if you plan on using it with your iPhone and your iPhone has protective hard case (and some rubberized cases) it will not fit into the iPhone unless you remove the case.  I solved this by purchasing an adapter for $25-so add that to the cost of the 3G Juice if you use a hard case or a rubberized case in some instances.  It definately will not work with an OtterBox case.",Negative
"This was not worth the money spent, it worked well but no quality on the design and durability. I asked for a refund but could not after 30 days.",Negative
Large ear piece did not fit in my ear. Very uncomfortable. Ear piece was broken upon receipt. Charger is not standard. Recommend that you keep looking.,Negative
"Got it September 2012, the background noise was always horrible, and became really bad when the phone was not close to the bluetooth device. If the device is in my right ear and my phone is in my left pocket the noise is unbearable. and after three months of use this thing dies under a minute of being connected to my phone.Guess you get what you pay for. I like how chunky it is because it stays put in my ear not like the new light ones that you don't know if they are on your ear or not.",Negative
this itiem is terrible plenty of back ground noise and static. I ordered 2 and find this to be a hugh mistake.,Negative

"I spent the extra bucks to buy a Plantronics. Unfortunately, I quit using the headset after my callers complained about the call quality.",Negative
Well at first it did work like for the 1st try then it got bad didn't work at all I bought for nothing don't even buy it...:,Negative
"For the price, I am not happy. It does as advertised, just feels like it will break. Plus that it folds flat for travel, minus that for a piece of molded rubber(?) it is [...] bucks.",Negative
I bought this before I bought a battery pack with the initials RS.  This offer no protection for the phone.  I later purched the battery pack by RS and a Clarifi case and am so mad I spent the $100 for this.  I would wait for it to go below $50 and then it would be worth buying.,Negative
I agree with what others have posted. The protector applies easily and the privacy works well without dimming the screen too much. Unfortunately the protector is so thick that the touchscreen no longer works after the screen is applied.,Negative
"I didn't expect the quality to be this bad.  Out of the three that I got, one has an uneven circle shape for the home button.What's really bad is that once you've put the screen protector on, you won't get a clear screen protector.  You can actually see the SOAP FILM like that on a bubble all over the screen.  I waited for a few days, but the soap film are still visible.  It's extremely irritating and unattractive.  I would not recommend this item at all! I",Negative
"a lot of money for just one piece of plastic, but it works and at least they've made the installation simpler...",Negative
"I don't know if I just got a bad set, but all 3 were way off on the cutting. To line up the ear hole, it causes the button hole to be misaligned and on top of that the whole thing was too large. it caused bubbles around the whole rim because it would not fit inside of the rim which is slightly higher than the screen. Horrible QC to say the least.",Negative
Fits very well. It can be a little difficult to apply.TIP: Do not touch the sticky part because you can't wash that off and you end up with a annoying fingerprint on your screen.,Negative
"I used this case for a year, from when I had my iPhone 3G till the 4 came out. Absolutely no issues with it!",Negative
"Nothing fancy about this charger - just a basic car charger for the iPhone.  Works for 3G, no issues or complaints.  Hard to beat the price!",Negative
"It is Good but the Camera is of very poor quality.. It has lot of functions, but sorry to say the phone was lost due to my negligence...",Negative
"This case is durable, but the outer rubber tends to stretch out and become very loose. The inner hard shell, is durable! I would recommend this item to others.",Negative
This thing hasn't failed me in about 40 drops.  I still used the old iPhone as an iPod and Alarm Clock.,Negative
"While a bit big for someone people, this is a very well engineered case for the iPhone.  I am really disappointed they do not make a Otterbox case for my new phone, the mytouch4g.",Negative
Protected my iPhone once it already had a crack in the back from a lesser case.  Lasted a full three years.  The one thing I hate: it was forever pulling my hair whenever I would take the phone down away from my ear.,Negative
"I bought two of these, one worked and the other never worked at all.  Very poor quality but I didn't expect much so. . . .",Negative
Hubby got this for his Ipod / I touch and works like a charm. Don't let negative reviews or price fool you!,Negative

bad battery is ded when it reached mei again i should call and get one morei recomand dont buy BlackBerry Standard Battery 9000 Bold,Negative
"I anxiously awaited this phone for a couple months, the day finally came and the phone arrived and what a disappointment it was!I spent about a week trying to ""get used"" to the feel of the phone, i really gave it every effort but the phone just didn't work the way it should have.  I know there have been software releases to make the phone work the way it was intended but I just didn't have the time to invest in it.I'll make this short and to the point, if you're a business/power email user then this phone will cramp your style, try it out for a week or two and you will see.  Numerous times buttons on the screen were accidentally touched and the camera would come on and different things would activate.The screen rotation system was horrible with a 3-5 second delay from landscape to portrait mode not to mention the phone is just awfully slow.And keep in mind, this wasn't just my phone, i ordered over 5 of these and everyone complained about the same thing, all were sent back.  Even now, a few weeks after the release people that have them still seem disappointed but are ""stuck"" with them.This would make a great phone for your teenager still in school, but if you use a BlackBerry to make deals happen and to manage your day then this phone is a sad disappointment!!",Negative
"This is just a rubber shell. I thought this was the whole Otterbox set....the plastic case, & then the rubber case over it. Nope, not this one. It's just a shell & doesnt go over my other Otterbox plastic cases, so this is useless for me  :(",Negative
I would buy it again if I still had an iphone 3g/3gs. protects your phone very well. It is not ideal to put in/out of pocket though...,Negative
"I had the Commuter for my 3GS and the thing I hated the most was that the case had to be removed in order for it be used in my dock.  Not with this one.  I also like that it is all rubber so when I do remove it, there are no plastic parts that will crack or break.  The Commuter broke within 4 months (yes the company replaced and the other one broke also).  At worst, this may stretch, but that will not bother me.If nothing else, this is a fantastic back up case for the price.",Negative
I purchased these units often because I am so hard on them but they protect so well that I always want one on hand.,Negative
This case was good for a while (couple months) then it started covering up the part of the phone makes it think you have it up to your face (3 little sensors in the upper left of the screen) and since it was covered it would turn off the screen thus make hanging up or doing anything impossible.  It was annoying.,Negative
"I bought this to put in my car as I am on the a lot of rural roads with poor service, and I like to stream music off of my phone.  I was barely able to pick up a bar of service, no matter where I mounted the antenna, and I still dropped calls in typical spots that I dropped them before I had it.  I couldn't ever tell a difference when it was working and when it wasn't, and after 3 months use the USB power port broke and it is now useless.",Negative
"Not sure what all th hip is about. This is one of the worst headsets that I've ever owned, and beleive me I've just about had all the expensive ones. The fit is just down right in the toilet. Constantly messing with the piece to keep it touching your jaw. The volume control is the worst design that I've seen. I could go on and on about the design of this bluetooth, but why,,,Just let it die. Theres better ones out there,,,ie plantronics 510 and the Voyager/Pro.",Negative
I returned my Jawbone after just one very frustrating day.All control buttons are hidden from view and touch. Attempts to adjust the volume cancelled my calls.Not recomended.,Negative
This is a very tough and well built case highly recommended.  I have had issues with clip cases because the clip always breaks and although you have to feed this one through your belt I know it will last.,Negative
"Unfortunately it did not fit my nexus 4 with the oem bumper on it. Would fit if I took bumper off perfect,but I like the bumper on it and wasn't gonna pay for a different bumper. To bad have to find something else",Negative
"This case didn't hold the phone tightly on my belt using the clip. As one might expect the ""loose"" clip broke after a month.Fortunately it has loops too, so it's still usable.",Negative
Don't let the picture and wording fool you.  This is not a good product.  Some type of fake leather wrapped around some thin cardboard.,Negative
"Nice quality, but it won't work with the iphone's otter box, so it's useless to me.  Anyone not using the outter box can't go wrong with this case.",Negative
you get what you get for the price. The &34;magnet&34; to close lasted a day. Dont waste a penny on it,Negative
"Genuine leather ..? the back piece is not leather, it's synthetic and bad quality material. So, the belt clip in a few weeks later is completely damaged ..It seems that poor quality starts from the factory as one of the side panels also came unstitched.A star, they do not allow half placed ..",Negative
"Once again I order another case that is too small. My case on my phone is about as thin as they make them, yet this was still too small for it. It fits in their, but its a pain to get in and out and it's always pushing the lock button when I put it back in. At least I could clip it to my belt, because most won't do that without stretching out the clip. Overall it will work for what I need as I only need it when I wear a black belt, which is not often. DO NOT ORDER THIS IF YOU HAVE AN OTTERBOX OR A LIFEPROOF IT WILL NOT FIT.",Negative
It looks nice but the quality is bad. Used only less than half year it's broken  already. Won't recommend this case to anyone.,Negative
I used this only for a few months. It was alright....did the job....very funky looking though....not a bad price though.,Negative
"I was looking forward to getting this Wilson Electronics cell phone signal booster because I've struggled for years with poor cell phone reception in my basement. However, after I hooked this thing up, I noticed very little, if any, improvement in my reception. At first I thought I might've hooked it up wrong, so I unhooked-rehooked it up a total of three times, with the same results. On occasion, I can see a temporary one-bar increase in my reception, but that's the exception, not the norm. The vast majority of the time, my basement reception is still horrible. Maybe there are other factors at play (my cellular carrier, house construction, etc.), but the minimal benefit from this product in my particular situation is the reason for my 3-star review.",Negative
"I think that this case is pretty cool.It is almost invidible.But the only bad part is it doesn't protect the silver or buttons.Other than that if your on a budget andwant to protect the back of your phone, get this.",Negative
"DON'T buy a defender case if you want small and sleek, it's big, it's bulky, but it's also a tough case, i work in construction and it's the case to depend on, i've broken lifeproof cases but so far not an otterbox.",Negative
Seems like a great protective device for the phone but god is it ugly and bulky! If you are clumsy or high risk I suppose it's a necessary evil.,Negative
"i bought this for a friend  of mine who has the samsung blackjack 2.Unlike other wired headsets, when you use this you cannot plug it in before or after a call. you have to call someone, and then plug it it during the call.whent he call ends you must remove it becuase when you are not talking anyone, the adapter has a bad habit of constantly redialing and hanging up over and over and over.I am not sure if its the adapters fault or the phones but i dont recommend this. use a bluetooth instead or get a new phone( or cell providor)",Negative
"Samsung's use of a proprietary jack for both charging the phone and connecting a headset is a miserable design decision, from the consumer's perspective. I'm sure it adds to their bottom line. I've tried three of these adapters from two different suppliers and none work with a known-to-be-functional headset. Giving up and going back to my bluetooth earpiece.",Negative
this is the 3rd or 4th pair of headphones they always stop working after a awhile. :/ and its always one side of the headphone.,Negative
"The sound is terrible.  The mic is bad.  The ear buds are uncomfortable.  The wires are thin and very fragile.  If you have not guessed by now, I would not recommend.  Spend a few dollars more and get better quality.",Negative
"I got this for by boyfriend as a gift.  He already had a T-Mobile sim card from a flip phone, but hated texting on it.  First, his address did not open up in the Blackberry.  Then we tried to open wi-fi and there is none on this phone unless you pay by the minute to T-mobile.  Since this phone was advertised as a unlocked phone, and the person purchasing it would be using an already existing sim card, THAT GPS THAT NEEDS WI-FI WOULD NOT BE LISTED AS A FEATURE. As far as I can tell, that means the GPS won't work either without a monthly package from T-Mobile. That also means you can't load apps and no Blackberry Messenger.Otherwise, I guess he likes the phone.  I, however, feel ripped off.",Negative
"Very convenient charging stand.  By docking it and putting your phone on clock mode while charging, it doubles as a desktop clock.  Once your phone is fully charged, however, it turns off.  The charger integrates with your current charger.  This is NOT a stand alone charger.  You plug in your existing charger to the base.  This unit merely lets you keep it in horizontal position so you can use it as a desktop clock.",Negative
"Can't go wrong with this item that seems to have been left out of all my Blackberry phone boxes.This is a RIM Factory product, very small and lightweight, and charges up both my Curve 8900 and my Storm-1 twice as fast as a USB connection.I was getting tired of having to connect my Blackberries to a PC for charging, which seemed to take all day, not to mention that there is not much need to do a wired snyc, so a real charger just makes a lot of sense.I bought one for the office and one for home. At this very low price per unit, it seemed like a no-brainer.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",Negative
I've bought a few dozen of these to hand out with our company blackberries and they have all worked without issue.  Would recommend.,Negative
I bought this for a gift and it was dead on arrival. Maybe it was just a bad one but the trouble it takes to return something bought online is just too much so I just trashed it.,Negative
"I just hate it when brick and mortar retailers think that they can abuse you just because you're in their store.  So when you buy a new phone, go online and buy this charger instead of paying 5x as much at the stupid verizon/sprint/tmobile/etc store!",Negative
This was LEGIT OEM and it works as it should. It was built well not cheap like the knockoff brands.,Negative
I've owned these for about a year now and recently switched out to the Jaybird blue tooth headphones which I prefer over these.  These are decent enough if you want to use them indoors but they are absolutely terrible if you want to use them outside.  They are nearly worthless outside unless you're holding your player in your right hand or have it in an armband on your right arm. Any other spot and they drop out like crazy.,Negative
"I never use them - always cutting out, even as normal telephone headset.  I tried with multiple types of phones, and it just doesn't cut it.",Negative
I got it so I could plug the Slime COMP02 12-Volt Tire Inflator in a wall socket but eventhough the little diode lights up it doesn't power the inflator !?Not recommended.,Negative
"I have not tried all the various functions of this phone, but it seems to work for everything I need it to do.  I don't like the round prongs power plug, but I had an adapter since I have lived in Shanghai for the past several years. I think the user interface is simply horrible to use.  The various functions are needlessly buried in layers of senseless options.  Try to make a call to a company that says press 1 for English, 2 for Spanish, etc.  You have to press and hold the touch screen area called unlock. Then you have to press another area to get a touch screen numeral pad.  By the time you get to this point, the number you called is asking you if you want to repeat the options. The microprocessor in this phone must be the slowest on earth. Everything is so slow and counterintuitive that I get upset everytime I use it. In text mode, they use the same layout as a digital phone. Why they didn't have the option of a Qwerty keyboard is beyond logic.  So there you are pressing every button once, twice or three times when it could have been a full keyboard layout. It does have the option where it tries to guess the word you are spelling, which is good. The phone is usable, but frustrating to use in my opinion.  I tried to give it to my brother, but he returned it to me saying it has the worst user interface in the world and he wouldn't take it even if I paid him money.",Negative
"This case was a little bulky. It seemed to protect the phone while it was on, but I was also a little difficult to try and take off once the case was on the phone.",Negative
"Not secure, and does not fit my HTC EVO 4 phone. It seems small even for the G1, but I do not have one to test. I did not realize that there was closing system such as even a zipper. I knew there was no secure flap.",Negative
"Bought one of these as a convenient way to charge and sync my Ipaq Glisten. While it will charge, it simply won't connect to the computer via USB. Tried it with another phone and another computer. Still no joy. There are other similar products on the market that work. So buy one of those, not this piece of garbage.",Negative
Works as intended although I'm not sure about the longevity.  Feels somewhat flimsy but gets the job done.  I have the feeling I'll be replacing this again in a few months of heavy use,Negative
"I have had this in my ownership 3 days.Today went to plug in my phone to the PC and POW!Spring over there, 3 pieces of plastic broken over there.Yes the wire still works but it is NOT retractable anymore!THIS IS GARBAGE!",Negative
This headset sucked and for the price it just annoyed me to pay that much to get a cruddy result. I lost lots of calls and no one could her me...awful.,Negative
"Purchased these or my husband as he does not like the in-ear Bluetooth headsets.  It s comfortable to wear, however it has trouble maintaining the Bluetooth connection to his iPhone 4S.  We have to pair it quite often and that is annoying to say the least.  I am somewhat disappointed as the reviews seemed pretty good for this unit.  When it won't pair he ends up holding the phone which makes me crazy as I refuse to drive and talk holding a phone.  I am guessing that I need to find him a better solution.  Money wasted!",Negative
"My husband usesit in semi. It blocks out truck noise, and wind when driving with the windows  down. Wouldn't even know he was using a headset.",Negative
These are not made to be used everyday with a phone that gets lots of use. It will work for a while then once the wire gets bent it will split.,Negative
not really sure why i bought it. I think i bought it for a friend but she already got one by the time this came in still in packaging.,Negative
"I have tried both the rubber ""bubble"" tip types and these foam-tip Pogos. For drawing, the Pogo Sketch beats all. The key to any of these things, is not press down as hard as you would with a pen or pencil. Doing so will likely burst your bubble (no pun intended) and/or wear away the tip. None of these pointing devices last a lifetime, but I've used my Pogo stick for well over a year, none the worse for wear.",Negative
"A total waste of time. Folks, learn the hard lesson I've learned, ONLY order items frm PRIME certified sellers. Ohterwise, you dont know what youre getting, spending your money like going to Vegas. Its a gamble.",Negative
"Very little money for this item. If you have family members who constantly loose or break phone chargers, then get yourself 3 or 4 of these as a backup. The day that they arrive, my son came to me needed yet another charger. What a surprise!!",Negative
"Do people still use Blackberrys? When I did, this little guy saved my skin a bunch of times while travelling. Pair it with a spare battery. Keep the spare charged...when one dies, swap it out. Two batteries should get you through the day. re-charge both at night.",Negative
"This item came quickly. I always like to have a few extras around, as I am a little accident prone and have ruined a few by closing them in the door, cutting them, and just losing them. Just gave a spare to my sister too.",Negative
"I Got this Phone yesterday and i`m returning it.The phone is just OK. and the sound Quality is the worst ever.It does not  worth the high price.I Cant Recommend this Phone.And I`ve had bad times with Nokia Phones.UPDATE:Before you buy this phone, Google, Create New Server Profile Nokia 5800.This is a Common Problem, And Nokia Has no Answer For this.",Negative
I MUST SAY THE PRICE WAS AWESOME.. BUT I MIGHT HAVE GOTTEN SOME BAD ONES.. BECAUSE THEY WOULDNT STAY ON.. :(,Negative
"Not long after receiving this product the holder broke, since its generic it was difficult to slip in my 3GS and eventually cause the clips to break",Negative
Definitely will order again from this seller. I've seen quite a few cases and was hard to decide which one I would settle for. This is a keeper!,Negative
"Very uncomfortable, people could not hear me well at all; would not stay in the ears. I sent back.",Negative
"I was given this headset to use during my workouts. After less than a month, it's started malfunctioning. It will randomly (and repeatedly) activate phone functions such as redial or voice control. When this happens, it becomes impossible to turn the headset off. Eventually it goes back to normal, but then it just starts malfunctioning again. Seems it can't handle a little sweat, which seems odd for a device that is made for sporty use.",Negative
"The wire in back will chafe your neck and grip your shirt collars, the buttons are not ideally placed, the FF/REW/VOL switch is cool but slow to operate, and they're inconvenient to charge. They aren't complete junk, but I do regret having kept them. :(Update: the left earpiece doesn't sit in my ear no matter how I orient the multiple adjustments.",Negative
The unit arrived on time. It worked.I bought it for my bro in law who does not shop on internet.With this we also got 3 cell phone batteries and another charger.All for less than $25 bucks including shipping!!How can you beat that???Did I say they all worked???Amazing Amazon.,Negative
Charges my Samsung Galaxy 4S while driving. Can use the phone GPS and other functions continuously without draining the battery. A must have accessory for the car.,Negative
"Made in China.The quality of this Samsung unit is questionable.The two halves of the case do not line up correctly, there is excess molding around the front where you insert it into the 12v cig lighter. The sticker was on crooked.I think this thing is a fake. Works fine on my Girlfriends Samsung galaxy, but doesnt work on my LG. Came in a small zip-loc style bag with no other information.I'd avoid it and get a different unit. I have owned samsung products in the past and they never have released anything as poorly built as this.",Negative
Should have read reviews before I ordered this item. Don't both buying for the Samsung S3. Snail pace charging. I wasted my money.,Negative
"Have had a few samsung chargers like this one before, and they honestly don't last very long at all. Don't understand why the crap out so easily, but be advised that you are taking a chance.",Negative
"I am highly disappointed with this product. Not to mention I received this product that fits a little loose into my actual car charger. It charges my phone on and off now. I really thought I wouldn't have to buy another charger for a while, but it looks like I was wrong! I bought a usb car charger (I just hook up my usb cord to my phone charger) for about 3$ from walmart and this product lasts longer and is more durable. I find it quite sad and I would never buy this product this again. It's like I threw money out the window go find another product.",Negative
"I bought this charger and it didn't work.  I obviously wouldn't buy it again, it was frustrating to plug my phone in and never have it charge.",Negative
I Bought it for my wife and she loves it.The battery time is very poor. I recommend you to buy a back up battery.,Negative
"The phone was slow and didn't even upgrade it, but the advantage was I could just put the international sim card into the device and it began to work",Negative
"iphone 3g is stale , out of date and boring......i would rather go with the samsung galaxy android phone rather than iphone and their ios that never changes in 5 years.",Negative
This phone worked for a few weeks and that's about it. It only worked until the time I could return it had expired.  I was not happy and would think twice about another purchase.,Negative
"Do NOT buy this phone. Just don't. The phone is slow and there are not many apps that can be used on this outdated phone. Also, my phone got stuck on the apple logo start-up screen after a few months of use because of the jailbreak. This phone was horrible. Do not waste your money!",Negative
"I lost this cable but when I had it, it worked like a charm, never bought another one because I tried other products.",Negative
I am not sure if this is an issue with my Blackberry or the cable but it does not work with my computers.,Negative
Fell apart after two weeks not a good quality item at all I would not recommend it to anyone looking to purchase a cord.,Negative
"Had no complains, but this is not something I would buy again for a long term use, is just to used it for some time, then you get tired.",Negative
This screen protector performs as shown. What it does not tell you is you can barely see the screen after applied.  I increased the brightness to 100% and still had a hard time seeing the screen.,Negative
I bought a bulk of these last year and finally ran out.  They are thicker than ordinary screen protectors but does not hinder the screen sensor.  Only negative is that during daylight it is hard to see whats on the screen.,Negative
These do not work well.  You cannot see the mirror portion and it is very difficult to apply.  I would not try a product similar to this again in the future.,Negative
"however, one thing that if u r using this one problem there..the mirror screen is hard to see it when day time..",Negative
Had to be trimmed down but it wasn't a problem. Product works as is advertised to protect your screen from scratches.,Negative
these are nearly impossible to put on without getting bubbles from dust.... I went through all 5 before i gave up completely.,Negative
Another gentleman who gave this product one star said it all for me. The product has a tab to help you put the protector on the phone... the tab does not come off completely so you are left with some sort of ugly goo that will not scratch or smear off. There is no way to get all the bubbles out and my package did not come with a card to help me remove the bubbles. I used 3 of the 5 screens so far and they all look horrible. Not sure why others gave it more than one star.,Negative
"Horrible quality, get what you pay for.  Reminds me of the plastic that comes on a fruit roll up. I will never buy these again, I bought something else that was shipped together and thought it was free ones that they sent as a compliment.",Negative
These are a waste of money to me because they put this white paper tab on them and once you put it on your phone you can't get the stupid tabs off them.,Negative
"I got these for my wife's iPhone 3G, and I have to say they weren't terrible but I have seen a lot better. I had to throw away two before I got one to stick without bubbles because they're pretty thin. More expensive versions I've never had an issue with. I guess you get what you pay for.",Negative
All five protectors were bent and would not adhere to the iPhone on the edges.  Poor quality.  I'd rate this zero stars if that were allowed.,Negative
"Bought this item on October 6, 2010, used till now. Worked as expected.No complaint. Would recommend to others too.",Negative
"It took forever to receive these since they come from China.  Also, it is almost impossible to install these without getting a speck of dust or an air bubble under it.  Then it looks like crap.  Just buy a good case.",Negative
"Well, I bought 3 of these because of the price and 2 work great with no problems. The other just doesn't work and gives me an error. I guess 2 out of 3 isn't bad. Really, you get what you pay for and don't be shocked if it doesn't work. Do what I did and just buy extras because you cannot go wrong with the price.Latest Update: 3/25/2013Not a good investment, they all failed within a 6 month time",Negative
"It charges and syncs my iPhone4, but I haven't tried it with any other apple products.  The item is NOT as pictured, but it connects/syncs/charges.  It may not work with some cases (had to remove case to get adaptor to fit and charge)Not bad for the price though.",Negative
I got this from ACC Stop at the end of May.  It was for my daughter so she can stay connected.  She probably charged the phone maybe 6 times since she doesn't use it much.  It died while on vacation and never accepted a charge back up.  Bad Battery.,Negative
This charger arrived in about a week and it charged my Samsung Galaxy Nexus and also my Samsung Galaxy S3 with no problems. I did not see that it charged any faster or slower than any other USB cord would.,Negative
"Works well. Had some trouble with it charging my phone initially because it was too loose, but propping it up on something helped. Not sure if its my phone or the charger.",Negative
Stopped working after just a few week. You get what you pay for. At least I am only out a few dollars.,Negative
"nothing really crazy to say, typical micro USB to USB cables. both connectors are firm and solid. plug right in and stay in",Negative
"For the price, I can't see how it can go wrong. Works right out the package. Will recommend to anyone.",Negative
"I use it at work everyday to keep my phone charged. No issues at all here! If you need a cable, buy it!",Negative
"I needed a cable to use in my car for a Samsung Galaxy S4 phone. This &34;Samsung Replacement USB Data Charging Cable for Samsung SPH-M330, SCH-R100,...&34; works. It will also replace a bad cable in the house if you have the little &34;brick&34; that plugs into the wall.",Negative
"The plug has started to fail, it does not stay in place all the time, yet it will still charge, it was definityle priced right.",Negative
I use these wires to use on Hard Drives otherwise charging phones its a little slower then normal but trickle charge no complaints.,Negative
Bad Samsung imitation. Does not work. The cable get loose on connection and it doesn't work. I though I have a deal but this time failed.,Negative
"Horrible. Did not stretch long at all. If I wanted to plug in my phone to the wall, it would have to sit on the floor. Plug was a USB but only worked in one phone.",Negative
"This item is as described, except my only complaint is that it wasn't actually a Samsung cable. I was disappointed. Plus, it recently started glitching up (constantly stops charging and I have to wiggle the wire a bit to get it working again).",Negative
this equipment is obviously not a samsung product. it takes bare minimum 2 hours (uninterrupted) charging time to get a full charge with this cable and even then the batter dies quicker than usual. I would not recommend this product to anyone else. I purchased 2 of them and they are both horrible,Negative
"I mean what else to say. It got here timely, it works, and its just like they said it would be.",Negative
got it for my kid cuz she lost her other charger works like its suppose to fits phone like its suppose to,Negative
I expected that I will have 40&34; cable but it was 20&34;. I am not sure if I missed any details when I ordered it.,Negative
"Other brands would fall apart after a couple of weeks. Not these! A little short, could be 6 inches longer.",Negative
These work well as spares and a person just needs spares.  No more trying to keep up with just one charging cable.,Negative
"This is a fake. If you can even get the phone to recognize the cord, it takes something like 12 to 16 hours to fully charge. Absolutely not acceptable.",Negative
Not really sure what  to say about this other than it works great.I need a few more.So I can have a few for my computer  so I don't have to keep switch this one back and fourth,Negative
It works with all my other equipment also. Works with no issues and I would buy this again if I needed one.,Negative
Nothing to say... Works good..........Extra words for the dumb 20 minimum word count.......Blah bla blaa blae blo blue blahs blohs blaaaaaa,Negative
"Bad quality, short, thin and breakable. I recommend buying a blue rigger 6ft usb cable. Its cheaper and much much better quality. Don't waste your money on this.",Negative
"It's even worse when my phone is in my pocket and I bend over, but the sound will (sometimes) cut out every second or two while I'm holding the phone 18"" away.  Checking with Motorola about warranty, but really disappointing.",Negative
Actually no it kept turning off and on and i dont know the reason so yea it didnt work it was a really very bad one ! Sorry,Negative
when i bought it in sept 2010 it was the phone i was waitng for. and i am to say it is still work up to know. cause i did resell it to a relative who still uses it alot. only thing i did not like at the time was that it tend to be slow and the picture quality from the camera was very poor.,Negative
"This skin was a breeze to slip on, and it seems to easily come off when I need it to.  That said, it also sticks tight when I *don't* want it to easily come off.That's the good news.  The bad news is not too bad:- you'll need to think ahead if you're going to stick the plectrum and wrist strap on:  feed that through the skin from the outside, thread it into the catch inside the XPressMusic's battery cover, then slip all the the skin around the phone.  Tricky, but it can be done.- access to the sides is not very easy:  it's nice that you can still press the volume buttons, but annoying that you have to mash down hard to flip the unlock switch:  the opening is too narrow and the skin is too thick.  A little bit of trimming here would probably have saved on a lot of wear and tear.",Negative
New out of the box and the speaker pops and snaps and crackles with every beat of the song.  Too bad I was playing a violin sonata by Debussy.  When I listen to a song I want to hear the music not the hiss of poor received signal or the rattle of loose and broken parts.I knew that at the low price of the speaker that I should not expect much but I did not expect for the speaker to be of such poor quality.PRO: Bluetooth connectivity worked.  Came with batteries.CONS: Loud beeps every time a button is pressed.  Speaker is unusable due to all the noise it makes.Cannot recommend.,Negative
"The speaker connects to audio sources pretty well. Controls are a bit confusing but acceptable. Audio quality though has nothing to do with manufacturers claims: it is a small speaker with average audio, meaning it is only usable to voice applications such as Skype or other VTC apps. It is not suitable for music playback.",Negative
"I heard the BOSE version of this style product but could not afford $300, so tried this $50 version.1st: the battery cover is flimsy: it was difficult to snap on and I was afraid I was going to break it.2nd: the stream was horrible. Maybe I got a lemon, but every 2 or three seconds the sound would stop and then start again... very irritating.3rd: the blinking blue night is also a huge irritation! Stop the blinking and make it steady.------------------My wallet said, &34;SPRACHT!!!&34; when it coughed up the dough for this toy.",Negative
This Bluetooth has out lasted a lot of my phon. I live in Wisconsin a very cold state and one thing i can say is that it has never giving out on me. I have even left it in my car when the weather was at it's coldest and it still works. I would highly recommend this product.,Negative
Its a little big for my plantronics m-50 & the zipper keeps colapsing when zipping/unzipping. The case itself is durable im just not happy with the zipper design.,Negative
"I like this product, because it is small and fits in my purse nicely.  My one complaint is that even though it has a hard shell which protects my bluetooth from damage, it can be squeezed and sometimes my bluetooth gets turned on while in it.  It can be annoying, but it's not too big a deal.  Overall I would say this product is mildly flawed but acceptable.",Negative
"This is the protective &34;box&34; I keep my BT in.  the color means I never lose it......for long!The case is hard enough to resist all the bangs and jostling it gets in my bag, and other people notice andask about it!  It also makes it possible to cut down on the amount of time it is on my ear....and reduce the amount of EMF to which I am exposed.",Negative
"Sadly,. though the description says the Plantronics Voyager Pro headset fits in this case - it does not. Not even close. I unfortunately discarded the packaging so I cannot return the three I purchased. My fault. Also, the zipper closure is very tight to the point of being almost impossible to open and close. Lesson learned - order 1, check for fit, keep the packaging and return it if it does not fit because the description was wrong.",Negative
It help open my case but one problem looks used and the picture says ill receive 2 clip openers and I only received only 1 was up with that and one for $2.99 and used not cool ill never gonna buy from this product ill just use my nails :/,Negative
"I purchased this as my first bluetooth headset because I thought it was cute.  Bad idea.  It has very poor, patchy sound quality and those that I speak to say it is echoey and hard to hear.  I have smaller ears and this is very uncomfortable to wear.  I am returning this for a different headset.",Negative
"Not worth the cost. works well, keeps things charged, but the car charger gets too hot at times, and I am afraid will damage my phone.",Negative
"tried at least six different bluetooth headsets as of Dec2010.Pros:-best audio quality from a bluetooth headset i've ever come across (incoming & outgoing)-fits very well on either of my oddly shaped ears without any discomfort-stays in place-easily connects when powering on (pairing is also easy)-range is goodCons:-when wearing, an almost uncomfortable amount of pressure is needed to press ANY button.-very noticeable from a distance (just look any picture)",Negative
"After a couple of months with this headset I have to give it a bad review. It does not perform well with my iPhone and often callers say my speech sounds all warbled and scratchy. Further, it's uncomfortable to wear and feels heavy behind my ear. I also cannot wear my sunglasses with it.I get much better mic quality either holding my iPhone up to my ear without a headset, or using the wired one that came with it.I regret my purchase of this Plantronics.",Negative
Very hard to operate.Hard to get synced up with the phones. Instructions do not help either. Waste of money,Negative
"I don't have a lot to say about this basic phone with Caller ID.For the price (11.00 delivered) I don't know if you could do better.Sound & Build quality seem fine.Comments about phone's base being lifted up & falling when you answer call, is operator error.  The little plastic do-hickey that the handset spring loaded button rests on is reversible. If the hand-set is lifted with the base - slide the do-hicky off and reverse it or even try removing and the problem should be solved.",Negative
I bought this for my IPhone 4 and IPod touch 4th Generation. This DOES NOT work on Apple. Not worth the money at all. I feel like I got ripped off.,Negative
I don't like this product at all only had for about 2 weeks and it's not working anymore so don't buy this product not good at all.,Negative
"I didn't buy this for a phone - I bought this for my husband who is obsessed with playing Modern Warfare on our PS3.  He had been dying for a chance to finally get to coordinate attacks with the other people on the Playstation Network.  I had avoided getting him one because I figured it would just encourage more playing.But then someone told me that you could use any bluetooth headset with the PS3.  So I snagged one of these off of the shopping god, Amazon.  After a little confusion in the part of set up (because SOMEONE won't read the instructions) we charged this bad boy up and he was chattering away.And then I discovered the wonder that I had never known... if he has the headset on - the rest of the babbling idiots are not cursing over my TV as the kids walk by.  Now it's not silent, the gunshots and background music still play, but I don't have to listen to a bunch of 12 year olds who just learned the F bomb drop it every chance they get.  It's like a miracle!  Had I known this I would have bought him one long ago.I haven't tried it on, but he says that it's comfortable and he played for several hours with no issues so the charge must be okay.  I can't comment on the quality in regards to a cell phone, but for the PS3 it's working like a champ.Highly recommended for people who are tired of listening to idiots screaming over their TV while someone else is playing the PS3.",Negative
"this replacement served him my cell phone and I could do the repair. Although you pay somebody to do the repair, the cost was very little. I recommend it.",Negative
This makes it easier for me to use my aging 3GS without opening it to replace the now half capacity battery.,Negative
"Somewhat delayed key responses and uncomfortable behind the ears. Sound output is decent No adjustment behind the ears, so either it fits or it won't.",Negative
Bluetooth pieces are falling off the market like flies off a baker's apron.  But this piece is probably one of the worst sound quality devices you can wrap around your ears.  The Bluetooth makes a very poor connection to your cell phone device and looses and regains connection strength as you are using it.  The result is a very poor sound quality experience.  Not recommended.,Negative
"I bought this headphones in January 2012. It worked well for couple if month but then started bad times when my return window is closed. Automatically disconnected from the phone without a reason. Worked well with Skype sometimes. I need to connect the headphone then start the skype app in my iPhone and log-in. (you need to follow this order). Then it'll work for the first call I make. If I want to hang up and make another Skype call, then I have to disconnect the headset, log off from Skype and follow the above steps again. Finally, + volume controller stopped working. So I couldn't use it anymore. Too bad!",Negative
"I was very disappointed. This item did not work right out of the retail box. The charge light came on red and never changed to green. The headphones would not power on. I was looking forward to these. I processed a refund (and was grateful for the Amazon process). I will not reorder because I see from other reviewers, and from somebody I know that bought the same headphones, that the overall product quality is poor and my experience was not uncommon.",Negative
"I was excited opening the package. After reading the directions, I plugged the unit in to charge, and waited, and waited, and waited.  The unit never charged.  Sent it back. Gave it one star - bad quality control - disappointed.",Negative
The head set band twists in the back and the ear cups separate away from my ears. The band also goes behind the ears and presses into the back of my ears and is very uncomfortable. This one may have been molded really bad. It keeps disconnecting from the phone and the phone is only 2 feet away. Keep shopping around.,Negative

"I purchased this charging dock, went throught receiving the wrong product and having to wait to receive the correct item at a later date. After all was said and done, the dock does not work.

Not going to bother complaining again, as it has gotten me nowhere. UGH!! I hope this seller enjoys my donation...",Negative
"I bought this kit for my wife. She found the touchstone quite cool.  The touchstone kit allows you to charge the Palm Pre without the annoying process of removing the micro-usb cover to insert the micro-usb charging cable into the phone.The kit comes with the phone back panel and one dock (hockey puck).  The dock has a reusable sticky surface on the bottom to hold it firmly onto your desk.You connect the dock to AC power via a micro-USB cable.  The kit does not include the micro-usb cable or the AC adapter - these come with your phone.  The instructions state that you should not connect the touchstone dock to a computer via USB; I think the average computer USB port may not deliver sufficient electrical current.The next question is, do you want to buy additional docks to charge your phone at the office or in the car?  You can order an additional dock separately.  If so, you may also need to buy an additional the micro-usb cable and AC power adapter (or car charger).",Negative
"You need this. You're battery life is terrible, like mine. Love the phone, but it would take two or three batteries to get through a day. So buy a couple.",Negative

"This case was TERRIBLE!Very flimsy, very pretty, very useless.  I was glad that I paid next to nothing for it because it was one of the cases that made me the most unhappy.  I am not a fan of cases that cover any amount of the front of the phone.  While this didn't cover too much of it, the poor construction wouldn't allow the case to actually snap closed around the phone.  I'm not sure if it was broken in shipping, or production, but by the time it got to the end user the product was useless.",Negative
What a piece of crap!!!!!  Magnet could barely hold a pencil let alone a heavy iphone 5.  If I could rate this product a half star that would be touch much credit.  Do not purchase this product.,Negative
The product is useless. It's so tiny for big size phone.I don't even know how this works. The metal plate is too thick to put inside of phone case and the power of magnet is too weak.Didn't want to bother return it only because it's a few bucks.,Negative

The second time I extricated the phone, all the stitches on the side ripped.  Very poor quality and does not fit Droid 2 Global as stated in description.",Negative
"So very disappointed.  The item arrived with one of its corners already broken (missing a piece of it, which was not in the package).  The cover is actually thick, it's not slick as it seems to be in the picture.  It's made of a cheap material and makes the iPhone so much larger than what it is without this cover.  In fact I believe that if it falls down, the cover will click open and will not protect the phone at all, so what's the point?  Look for something else!",Negative
I didn't like this case at all but sold it on FB to try to get my money back sorry.,Negative
I don't think this was constructed to actually charge 2 items at once.  Just because it has the 2 usb slots doesn't mean it can tolerate the juice.  My gave out soon after purchase.,Negative
"This item failed on first use. When I opened it up (I'm an electrical engineer... I had to open it, didn't I?) I found a decent circuit board, average components and the worst soldering job ever. What failed? The wires that were soldered to the back of the steel plug blades were cold soldered and came apart. Plus the blades were held in place with a friction fit which also failed, leaving exposed metal in the socket when the plug came apart. Construction is so bad that I estimate that the electrical integrity is likely just as bad and may actually harm delicate electronics like cell phones. Be careful and avoid this one!!!!",Negative
"I dont usually get expensive accessories,  but I decided to splurge on something nice for my new Palm Pre.Unfortunately you do not get what you pay for,  the tabs that hold the case onto the phone broke after a month of regular, well cared for use,  so now the expensive case does not stay on the phone and is worthless.  Save your money.",Negative

"Hard to use because it keeps falling out of your ear. Not a very good product. Find something else, that's my suggestion!",Negative
"It's a bad and used battery even though it was listed as new one.  It has crack on one corner.  Charged it for whole day, put in the phone still have no juice.  Waste my $5.............",Negative
Battery wouldn't hold a charge and was faulty from the beginning.  I was very disappointed and would not recommend his to anyone. Total waste of money!,Negative
"Horrible customer service - when contacted directly because I was dissatisfied with the product, he(she) resorted to personal, verbal assaults instead of dealing with the issues - wow - unbelievable.  Don't waste your time here - they charge a 50% restocking fee for returns! Review update: the seller is ALTEC.  I would like to stress that my comments are directed towards this seller, not the product itself - the headphones themselves were fine, no complaints there.",Negative
"I broke my belt clip.  Needless to say, I was beside myself for the 3 days it took to get another one in my possession.  I had to carry my phone around in my pocket! GASP!  Hahaha!What can I say, this product is a direct replacement and behaves as such.",Negative
"Good.It works as expected.As it is a charger it either works as expected or not. I don' actually &34;love it&34;, but as it works as expected I am giving it five stars.My only issue was wrong plug type, but this was immediately resolved by seller.",Negative
"I have this exact charger that came with an earpiece, BUT the one I received from amazon does not match the one that came with the samsung earpiece.  The color is grayish ... the cable material is different ... the cable length is different ... micro usb plug is different ... everything is slightly off ...so ... it is a very close copy but not a genuine samsung product ... I am not going to risk using it on my phone and damage my phone :(at least it was less than $5 ...",Negative

Arkon makes quality products for your smartphone and I have yet to be disappointed by their products. Simply attach this little guy to your vent and you are set.I am a bit of a perfectionist so I removed the 'generic' holder and used epoxy to glue the backer plate (removable) to a cut off case which fits the phone exactly. The mount itself however has never fallen off or broken in the 6 months its been in my car.,Negative
"I bought this as a portable phone holder for while I travel and use rental cars.  I wanted something that I could put my phone into, that would charge it while also allowing it to be my GPS.This device is very bulky - taking up a lot of room in my suitcase.  It is also complex (with multiple hinges and connectors to give it flexibility in how you can position it).  Unfortunately, all of that complexity makes it somewhat delicate.  It broken the third time I used it when I pushed it a little too hard.If you're going to install this in one car and keep it in place, it'll probably be fine.  But I wouldn't recommend it as a part of your &34;travel kit&34; to install in different rental cars.",Negative
"Not sure how long this will last.  It feels flimsy.  I also think this is designed to be put in place and never moved again.  The sticky base part may not stand up to a lot of moving.  Once the rubber part gets a lot of dirt and lint on it, it will not stick as well.",Negative
I found it hard to see the iPhone in navigation mode and hard to remove the phone to answer it. I'm no longer using the mount. My car has blue tooth so the latter is less of an issue. The phone won't go into the mount with a bumper on it.,Negative
"The SmartPad did not work on my Saab dashboard at all. It held for about 30 seconds total. I'm very disappointed, but I'm hoping the suction will stay on my windshield.",Negative
I bought these screen procters with the battery and cover all for my LG Dare. I did one of the combo deals on the bottom of the page. I ordered them two days ago and already revieved my screen protectors . Thank you. I was in desperate need of another one and it seems that will all the newer versions of phones coming out its harder to find stuff for it.,Negative
The product is old stock.  The sticky tab will not clean off the protective covering w/out scratching it.  Disappointed. Not a Deal At All,Negative
"These are the worst screen protectors I have ever purchased.  I am always applying new ones every three months and I have no problems with bubbles and all that and if there is one or two I can get them out, but these were terrible.  I went through all three of them trying to just get one on without thousands of bubbles underneath and they were thicker than usual protectors.  I will not buy this again.  I went to wal-mart and bought them.  Paid more money, but no bubbles.  This item appears as the seller described but did not work as supposed to.  Thanks but no thanks! :(",Negative
I have not gotten this part either at my house so i went to the p.o. and the post office said it hasnt gone past forwarding please fix it! its been a LOOOOONG time. This should have already been here also,Negative

"Elsewhere I purchased BlackBerrys and have been installed with the Spanish language, unfortunately these do not last due tirnen download and hope it does not present other problems",Negative
The phone was a little overpriced but as for the product itself! Has lasted me a very long time so I give it four stars.,Negative
"I also purchased that fish-looking one which was terrible because the opening was too big and the cord didn't stay in.This product, however, is excellent!Thanks!Mike",Negative
"I like the simplicity of this item, and the fact that it has a small clip that you can use to clip onto a backpack, purse, etc.  What I don't like is the ends where the Curvyman has a small slit to allow you to work the ends of your headphone thru so they don't unravel (look at photo close up in the description).  I have been trying to wiggle these ends around/manipulate them a bit to soften them up.  I have only used mine a few times so far, and hoping the plastic will soften up a bit to allow the cords to slide thru with less friction.",Negative
"It works, but only with very thin earbuds.",Negative
"No frills cord winder upper thing that works as it should.  If you have really long ear buds this might actually be a little too small.  I use one in my gym bag, one for another set of ear-buds on my motorcycle keys.",Negative
its really smalllike 1x1inbut it does what i need/ want it to dothe ehh part is that if you wrap headphone with the microphone part its kinda annoying because the curvyman is so smalli use it for my iphone5 headphones,Negative
The car charger did not fit my Curve 8530 and neither did the face cover. Buyer beware,Negative
"The LCD protector did not fit my phone from the start.  This caused it to blister on the edges which in turn caused dust to buildup and eventually push the protector away from the LCD it was protecting.  The Plastic case that comes with this devise is made of such poor materials that the clips that hold it together broke while putting it together.  I basically paid the money to use these items for 1 day.  Not worth the money, and it was in shipping longer then it worked on my phone.",Negative
"this item was broken when I received it, the edge was broken when I opened the soft pack that it came in.",Negative
"It charges the way it's supposed to.  However, the fact that you have to use their iphone case is kind of annoying.  Also, the charging station is kinda big and ugly. I wife doens't like it always on the table.",Negative
"I, like many cellphone users, was really excited when this product was announced. Induction charging is the wave of the future of charging small portable devices... unfortunately Duracell's MyGrid is the stuck in the flood of the past; still using connectivity to charge devices - albeit in a clunky, ugly, inconvenient way.For some reason I had in my head that the unit would utilize a tiny little dongle that would contain all the components needed to charge your phone. But, as I'm sure you've seen, the dongle connects to a bulky round disc which houses the charging system. On the disc are charging prongs which when mated to the base mat form a circuit for charging. So rather than look around for my cellphone charger I now look around for a bulky disc, not really more convenient. Of course I could tape the disc to the phone, increasing the phone's girth and weight and rendering my cellphone belt useless... but again that's not really more convenient is it?Frankly I don't see a situation where anyone benefits from this device. Poorly thought out with aging tech. Avoid.",Negative
"I watched the bad reviews, but was hopeful because of some of the positive ones.  I have an ancient RAZR that drives me crazy because it's always out of juice.  Well, this was a complete waste because even with this new battery -- charge lasts less than 24 hours.  ugh.save yourself the time and money.  buy locally and return the battery if it doesn't work....like this one.",Negative
This is a sturdy case but too small for Droid X with protective case. It has to stretch to hold the Droid X without the case and it is very difficult to put the phone in or take it out.,Negative
"There's really not a lot you can say about this, it's a cable.  It has the mini-connector on one end and the other is a USB connector.  I used it to put music on my wife's phone and it worked the way it was supposed to.",Negative
This charger worked only for one month.  After a month it would not charge my phone anymore.  I am not satisfied with this product.,Negative
"what can I say, I needed another cable to hook my phone to my computer to download pictures, and received the cable and am in business loading down pictures",Negative

it worked for the first week then it only charge my phone to 20%. it is a waste of money.,Neutral

"does not have the need amps to charge things like ipads, or hp touchpads. but its super small and compact.",Neutral
After a week only one side works,Neutral
"Only works one side at a time. When you connect two cables, one side stop working and also overheated burning the fuses. I purchased two of them and it's the same problem. Cheap and bad quality.",Neutral
Didn't last very long. Worked great when it worked but it is a cheap piece of plastic crap so I shouldn't have expected it to last.,Neutral
"I bought this so that I could use and charge my Tab at the same time. My tab does not recognize the high power port and will either charge while off or use power while on, it will not charge while powered on.",Neutral
"I bought 2 of this and tried to test first ... after few minutes of charging, it felt hot. Pulled it out and the product smelled burnt. Tried the other one too and same thing. Be careful... this one could be fire hazard or could potentially destroy the electrical system",Neutral
Bought so we could charge to phones at the same time while in the car from the same port.  Works.,Neutral
"I was worried about this order because the picture on the description page kept changing to a less-desireable green/orange cover.  But alas, it came a day earlier than expected, and the beautiful pink product expected!  The ""rubberized"" cover feels a little greasy (like it was armor-all'd), but the design is gorgeous and a little 3D looking!",Neutral
this cover makes an old phone look and feel new. I like that I can order covers for little money and snazzy up my phone.,Neutral
Bought as a spare charger for the house and turned into my main charger because my other one failed. Nice long cable and has held up for tons of charges for my Galaxy S3.,Neutral
The charger only lasted a week ad after that it just stopped charging my Samsung Galaxy S3.  They really need to start making these chargers better....I've been thru several!!!!,Neutral
"This Charger is awesome! First of all I wasn't expecting it until between 12/12  and 12/17, but it arrived on 12/11,So That was a plus for me! Second, I was kinda skeptical about purchasing it because it says that its for a Galaxy S and Blackberry so that can mean a lot of things! but I figured what the heck its cheap, so what can I loose!  Well, I just got it today and decided to give it a try at work on my Galaxy S4,  it charged  from 80%  to 100%  in about 7 minutes!! Yes i timed it!  and also the cord is long which is a plus for me!  So if your looking for a fast charger with a long cord and not to mention a great price, this is the one!!update:  not sure what the other reviewer meant by saying these are poor quality chargers, because I've had mine for a little over 2 weeks and it's still going strong!!  Love this charger  especially  for the length!!",Neutral
I purchase this for a backup at work.  It charges my SGS4.  I would recommend this charger for the Samsung Galaxy S4.,Neutral

It works great  thus  far no issues.  The only thing i might have limited was a usb Connect or it charges my t989 without fail,Neutral

It charges fast and is dependable.",Neutral

You have to hold it in a certain place in other for it to charge. I'll just buy the Verizon  charger instead,Neutral
"This thing worked well when it actually functioned, but today it stopped working and I am past the 30 day return window by 10 days give or take.I'm guessing the quality might not be great as that is why it stopped working, who knows.. What a waste of money.",Neutral
"I've been using this for about 4 months now and it works just as it is intended.  I would buy again.  Quality product.The cord could stand to be a little longer, but it is of a decent length.",Neutral
"Got this to replace a frayed OEM cord. The cord itself is ok ;however, the plug that looks like OEM and is stamped as such, is crap! Took 8 times longer to charge with this unit! When the cord was paired with the actual OEM plug in, it worked fine. So if you need a cord its ok; however, it is definitely not OEM and the plug is worthless. For the price and really just needing a cord it is a good value but I am very disappointed with the false markings as OEM when it is certainly not.",Neutral
I thought this would be a Samsung product but look like a cheap counterfiet. It came crushed and is slow to charge my phone.,Neutral
"although i do not use the charger, the cable is useful.  it is longer than what is given with the phone.  the additional length allows the phone to be placed in plain sight, instead of down by the wall receptical",Neutral
I haven't had any problems with it.  It just like the oringal charger that comes with the Galaxy S 2.,Neutral
"I would like to start off by saying that this product is what I ordered and I have no complaints about shipping or the condition of the product when it came to my house, the problem I do have is the micro usb cable that comes with the charger. Why is it that all of the different companies that sell chargers on Amazon can get the plug part of the charger right but not the micro usb cord? The cord is cheap and not the original cord that comes with the other part of the charger. I am having the same issue with the charger that I ordered for my galaxy note 2. It's a very thin cord, and also very short. Maybe, a 2 21/2 foot cord? And its of a cheaper quality than the part of the charger that the micro usb plugs into...",Neutral
thank you. it did not disappoint. was as expected and does the job though I am going to a new phone as the galaxy 2 has been acting up consistently. shutting down by surprise etc...,Neutral
"In a nutshell, this is NOT an OEM charger.  Although it has the Samsung markings, it doesn't seat well with a Samsung phone.  This means that it's either meant for another market or it's counterfeit.  With that said, I wouldn't buy this again.~~~~~~~~~~August 17, 2013 - UpdateThe seller tried to make amends by sending me three replacement chargers.  After using this for a while, it is still garbage.  It does not charge my phone and in fact, it drains the phone.  This must be a counterfeit product.  It has Samsung markings but it does not charge the phone.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!",Neutral
"After 2 weeks my charger just fell apart while i was taking it from the plug , not a strong charger at all i would have asked for my money but it wasn't even worth it .",Neutral
Bought one for me and another for the wife. Acts as phone protector and charging case in one. Hold charge all day so no complaints.,Neutral
"I was surprised it game in three steps, but when i put the case together and slid my phone in, i loved it. It is hard to get off",Neutral
This one came in broken  The bottom pice snaps on to the sides and the main backing is a inlay piece. Came in scuffed with paint and the pieces will not click in together. If it was not broken I would like it. Also if it wasn't in three click in pieces,Neutral
"Wow!  What a cute battery case! I saw a Christian sister with one of these on her phone!  That gave ne an idea-I decided to order me and my sister a battery case-mine is white, (since my phone is white), and my sister's is black,(since her phone is blue).Anyway, these little guys give you power for your phone! If we run out juice, especially when on the go, we can just connect this case to our phone, and it is POWER ON THE GO!! (I'm just concerned about the functionality).",Neutral

"I never do this, but I almost bought this product based off of the amazing sounding fake reviews provided by the shills for PowerBear. If you look at all the positive reviews for this case, you will see that none of them are verified purchases and yet every negative review, other than this one of course, is a verified purchase. What that means is that everyone who has actually bought and used this product thinks that it is crap. Furthermore, many of the reviewers have posted twice on this product, once per color. Why Amazon allows this is beyond me, but that is not the point. Also, if you look at the profiles of the positive reviewers, you will see that they have posted multiple positive reviews for PowerBear products and many of the reviews are carbon copies of each other. Beware the paid shills!",Neutral
Bought case for me and wife to qualify for free shipping. Came in different colors to match phone.  Can go entire 24 hours without charging; but I am not a kid playing games all day long. No complaints or problems. (Personally I wrote another review in the wrong spot since we had diff phones and diff colors I f&%$ up),Neutral

I was looking for a case for my new Galaxy S2 (At&t version). The store was selling similar cases for $20 and $35. I just can't justify spending that much on a case. This case is made for the unlocked version of the Galaxy S2. The size is the same. The only difference that I can see is the noise cancelling microphone is blocked. I drilled a little hole in the case and it works just fine,Neutral
"I bought this for the at&t samsung galaxy s2 and the seller was very slow in getting this item to me. I also notice that this product do fit the SGS2, but the cut outs was NOT good. The cut out opening was too small for the power button, there was also an extra cut out for no reason. It does fit nice so I gave it 2 stars, but bad opening for my phone will be costly.",Neutral
I prefer this style case to the otterbox and case mate as I feel it provides ample protection without turning the phone into a brick. Lightweight and sleek.,Neutral
I read the first few reviews and didn't read any further and now I wish I had cause this thing does not work for the Sprint Galaxy s2. Wish I had known that.,Neutral
"A note of caution from someone who owned and used just about every major Blackberry model: if you already own a standard USB 2.0 cable and you don't need an extra, then you do NOT need this cable. All a Blackberry needs for data transfer is a STANDARD USB 2.0 cable with a Micro-USB connector at one end.There is NOTHING special about this cable and nothing justifies the artificially inflated MSRP listed for it. While this item is sold at a 90% off the MSRP discount, it's probably okay to purchase one, for as long as, after reading the first paragraph you decide that you will need a USB 2.0 cable.The items has 2 stars taken away for the exaggerated marketing claim (professional grade custom cable) and for the inflated MSRP.NOTE: Please make sure that you buy cable with a MICRO-USB connector because this is what your Blackberry needs.",Neutral
"This charger does the trick.  The charger in my car doesn't work when the ignition is off, and who wants a dangling cord hanging down in their field of vision while driving.Have charged the T505 up once since I got it, and the battery life is reported to be around 18 hours of usage or 30 days of standby.  I may charge it every couple of weeks.  Very convenient accessory.",Neutral
"I was initially leary about purchasing this item due to the extremely low price and to have free shipping also, but I needed a wall charger since Motorola only includes a car charger with their wireless car phone speakers.  So I took a chance (due to the low price and free shipping) and was pleasantly surprised.  The charger appears to as well made as the other after market chargers I purchased previously for my e-book reader, PDA, camera, etc., and at less than 25% of the cost.  I charged my Motorola speaker without any problems.",Neutral
"This is clearly not a HTC cable as it has the Blackberry logo on it and the bulk packaging label says Blackberry...but it's a OEM micro usb cable none the less and works perfectly on any micro usb device I plugged it into.While I haven't tested it's speed against other cables I doubt it outperforms any other OEM cable but it works and that's all I asked for of it.The cable is a bit thick and as a result is stiff but not unmanageably so.It should also be noted that the cable shown in the picture is not of the actual product, that is a mini usb cable and appears to be quite a bit longer than the product, this cable is 1m long.",Neutral
"""This cable not recommended for this device."" That is what I get for an error message. Plus it is really short.",Neutral
well bought this so i could have a spare cord since i have the original cord in my car with a usb charger there got tired of keeping track where i had it last.  so this cord works on when plugged into the wall.  when hooked to a pc phone wont stay connected to the pc to transfer files or anything.  so if you just need a cord to plug into the wall this will work but don't even think of this cord if you want to use it with a pc.,Neutral
It is what it is. A charging and sync cord. It charges the phone and helps transfer data from the phone to the computer.,Neutral
It works and is a good value for the price compared to the retail stores. The only negative is that it is just a tad too short.,Neutral
Purchased this USB cable to connect my Samsung smartphone to my laptop computer.  Works well and fits my needs and expectations.,Neutral
do you need to charge your phone? so you need to transfer data? then boy oh boy this cable does that.,Neutral
Disappointed at how cheap they are and doubt they were designed for newer devices.  They are also very short.  Took a long time to ship.  Specifically purchased due to the ad saying they were for Samsung Galaxy devices.  It did not work in my S4.  They require a good charger a d one that is newer and better.,Neutral
damaged charger. when i recieved it the charger had a short in it. i had to wiggle the cord for my phone to charge.,Neutral
"The plug fits and it charges my Captivate, it felt rather snug. The ""retractable""-ness of this charger is anything but. Plain ol' doesn't work. I literally took it out of the package, and the first time I pulled the cord out - didn't yank, tug, or otherwise forcefully pull it - about 10 inches and hit the retract button to test it out and it retracted about 2 inches of it. I pulled it out further, retracted about 4 or so inches of it. Bottom line was that after messing with it and *feeding* it back into the charger versus it retracting itself automatically when depressing the retract button, it took a few minutes to get the plug retracted so that only a few inches of cable was still hanging out of the charger and that was the best I could get. The cable would only automatically retract 2-4 inches at any given length. The main reason I wanted this was for the ""retractability"" since I hate having cables dangling around.Working on getting a refund for this item now.",Neutral
I've used this for almost 2 years now and it JUST NOW broke. But I can still used it. The button that retracts it just got loose so it doesn't latch anymore.,Neutral
"took longer than expected to be delivered but over all satisfied with the charger. the retractable cord is just long enough to reach the cup holder in my truck where i usually put my phone. down side, ive already got 2 welps on my arm from retracting the cord! be careful! haha.",Neutral
"This works just fine to recharge my Captivate. With some products, it's impossible to get a good tight connection to the phone at the USB end; this one does not have that problem.",Neutral
"When i went to take the charger out of my wallit snapped in half. Lesson learned,cheap things break too quickly.",Neutral
"This power cord is a great replacement for the standard dual use cord that comes with your phone. By dual use, I mean, the standard cord that comes with your phone is a usb data cable with a dc power plug on the end. Sometimes I am using the phone and just one twist or tug of the line and the cable will disconnect from the dc power supply, which I imagine will cause the data cable to short out over time and also may ruin the battery. Phone companies just got cheap and decided to stop sending phones with a power cable AND a data cable separately, but in the end, you will go out and get yourself a standard power cable...like this one, which is just fine...quality-wise and price-wise. Yep. Oh, and this does have a big red light that comes on once you plug it into the wall, whether your phone is plugged to it or not, so if you are one of those nit picky sleepers that needs a completely dark room to sleep, you stick yourself a small piece of black electrical tape over the light, because it is brighter then you may think.",Neutral

"Excited about this based on good reviews, but did not have the same experience.Tested on my Nexus S cell phone, person on the other end complained about static and poor quality sound.  I unplugged headset and switched to using my cell, and they said the problem went away, so unfortunately problem seems to be with this headset.Also, just FYI, this does not come retail packaged, but shows up in a plastic bag with no instructions.  Not a problem for me, but makes me wonder where these are from and the quality.",Neutral
"I've tried and returned at least 5 headsets ranging from $15 to $150. This one was typical of the others that I returned, low volume on the earpiece and low quality microphone. I finally ended up with a Panasonic TCA60 for about $19 which is very loud and sounds great on both ends. It's nothing fancy, no volume control and no mute, but who needs that when you can accomplish the same thing with your phone. Price does not determine sound quality. I recommend this product.",Neutral

"This comes with 4 flats and 2 philips. I believe they are also metric in sizes. I used one to take a part a netbook. I like the fact that they spin, come in a plastic kit. They are reasonably priced. These items are high quality. Handles are small and can be hard to loosen a screw if torqued down. I used them for a laptop not as a jeweler so... Nice case, nice color, small area, ... Comes in a card board cover as well. Packaged and more packaged. A little over doing it there. Can't be at times a little difficult to open the plastic case. Was going push up or down. Comes with different sizes. Some of the flats seemed a little thick in the blade. Not a bad item for the price. Always good to have a set of these around for glasses/sunglasses or for other items with small screws.",Neutral
"plastic pry tool kinda sucks, but all the other tools in the kit are quite handy, helped me fix a broken screen on a $500 phone so saved a bit of cheddar there.",Neutral

I received it today and it doesn't charge. I'm sure it is used - I found a piece of broken iPhone glass on the contact side.,Neutral
"It's $6 so I don't know if I'm asking too much. The screw drivers work and are slightly magnetized. The prying tool is completely junk and broke before I had even finished my task - a guitar pick is much more durable. The tweezers are also worthless.

I have several revolvers and pistols which have sight adjustments that have outrageously small adjustment screws.  For these sights this little kit is a must -- none of my other tools could manage to fit these screws but this one did.

"On the recommendations of a few reviewers, I tried these gels for my Jawbone headset. Unfortunately, they did not fit well and came off every time I took the headset off. That was too bad because they did seem somewhat comfortable and did direct the sound into my ear for a louder and clearer sound. However, I returned them because of the poor fit. They would probably work well on some other headsets. If they fit your headset then I would give these gels a try.",Neutral
I bought these to redirect sound into the ear for my jawbone. TO that end it worked like a champ. the only issue I have is that after about a year they started to yellow. I guess that is common with these clear jelly products though.,Neutral
"These are the exact ones that I was looking for but there is one problem.  They are supposed to be clear but they arrived yellowed in the package.  It is obvious that they are new, but they have yellowed and are no longer clear.  I bought these to replace existing ones that I have that have yellowed but not to the extent of these new ones.  I have had the previous ones since 2010.  I will keep as spares but am unhappy with the condition of these EarGels.",Neutral
"I like this Jabra earboom so much that I have purchased 6 of these so far.  And that is my biggest complaint, is their poor quality of workmanship.  They work well but just don't last.  Granted, I'm a road warrior and my earbooms probably go through more abuse than a casual user.  The reason I keep buying them is the audio quality is fantastic and the fit within my ear is solid.  I keep two spares on hand at all times so as soon as one fails I can throw it away and move on.  At this price, I can afford it.  Also, Jabra customer services is great.  I lost the windscreen for the boom mic once and an email to them got me a set of windscreens in my mailbox, no charge.",Neutral
"The gel inserts on the Jabra is quite uncomfortable, at least for me.  It's a bit hard to make the earbud stay in my ear, and forget about jogging wearing this.  Also the insert comes off very easily, and if a friend wants to borrow it and has different size of ears, you need to find the other sizes of the insert.  Sound quality is mediocre, as callees often complain about wind noise from my end.  I'm not happy with these.",Neutral
My moms car couldn't have an upgraded radio (freaking saabs...) but one of the two positions didn't work. Still worked for her though.,Neutral
"I tried using it with my Sansa Clip MP3 player in my Toyota MR2. The car makes a lot of noise in any case, so I'm not holding out for audio lab quality. However, the product made a quite audible (at low automobile speeds) click-click-click. I might have been able to tolerate that. However, there was also an electronic whistle increasing in frequency with the RPM of the engine. The whistle interfered excessively with the intended sound from the player. The volume of the Coby CA-747 was ok. I hadn't thought that would be an issue until I bought a comparable Maxell cassette adapter at Long's to replace the Coby CA-747. The volume with the Maxell product was very weak, and I had to turn it way up. The Maxell didn't go click-click-click, but it whistled, too. So both the Maxell and the Coby get 1 star from me. I'm trying out the offering from Philips next...",Neutral
very disspointed not getting a coby cassette tape because it did not work in my car :/ i need my music,Neutral
But will keep this short and sweet -Cord contains lead and must be handled regularly in a car where there is nowhere to clean your hands after touching the thing.Sound quality quickly goes downhill with crackling evident after only 5 uses.Now stuck in my dashboard player because the modular adapter broke off and the cassette will not fully eject. I am sure the husband will be griping the entire time he tries to get it unstuck.Avoid at all costs!I scanned past the negative reviews since this product had a few really positive reviews with a lot of helpful votes. Big mistake as now I have to unstick the adapter from my cassette player and try to get Amazon to take it back. (I bought 2 on clearance),Neutral
"I would like to say that this is not cheap junk, but it did nothing at all for my cell reception.On the other hand I have an iPhone with AT&T;, so it could be that combination doesn't work with it.It appears it worked for a few people with a different phone, so I am going to be generous and give it 2 stars, taking into account it could have been my unit.;-)",Neutral
Want to try one? They sell these at the dollar stores. It does nothing to improve your signal.,Neutral
I set my phone down on my computer desk for 10 minutes and I checked the Signal Strength on my Droid X and it read -87 dBm. After putting the Universal Cell Phone Antenna Booster on the inside of my batter cover I set my phone in the exact same spot for 10 minutes and It read -83 dBm (closer the number to zero the better the reception). So I guess it works a little bit. Check out the picture I posted of the signal strength before and after.,Neutral

"I got a pair of Plantronics-branded headsets in Verizon OEM packaging (plastic bag), each coming with a ""universal"" adapter (micro-USB male to 2.5mm female). The price was substantially the same (per unit). But there is a small issue--there are two sets of pictures on this product that represent two different units. The two on the right, with the plastic bag that is clearly labeled MX150xxxx are identical to what I have. Note the obvious button showing through the plastic (this one mutes, turns off the call or voice-dials on my Blackberry, but it may do other things on other models). However, the other photos show the same headset, but without the control button--not a different button, but nothing at all! This made me wonder what is being sold as MX150. The other issue is color. It's not clear if you get the black or a gray one or even if there is a choice. From the photo, one would assume that this dealer supply the gray ones, but I am not so sure. This is not exactly an item one buys for style points (it's compact, but looks bulky on the face), so it's a minor point, but it would be good to have some clarity.But, as far as the product itself goes, it's perfectly functional for the purpose--cheap branded headset (for me, specifically to complement a BT set, which this one replaces when charge runs out). I've had a number of cheap or free headsets (often even enclosed with a phone) and virtually all of them have awful raspy and tinny sound. That's not what I want in a headset, even for $3. But I needed an emergency headset and this one fit the bill. The sound quality is far superior to no-name headsets--on both ends. It's better than an average Sony/Ericsson handset--I always add a headset to those when using them since Sony deliberately puts crappy speakers into Ericsson phones to make you buy their headsets. When traveling through NY or DE or any other state that requires no-hands on the phone, it is essential to be quickly disconnect and replace a discharged BT headset. I have no qualms about using this one.UPDATE (9 months later): I got another of these sets for a friend but, although it fit, the phone rejected it as not compatible. It was a cheap ATT/Nokia handset to replace a lost phone so I am not surprised about compatibility issues. But that also meant that I got an extra set. About a month ago, one of the sets died when the phone got yanked too hard (probably a loose contact). At less than $2 each, I had no problem tossing it and pulling out the next one (and I still have two more left, having spent a total of $6, including shipping). So, aside from Nokia compatibility, still no complaints.",Neutral
"I purchased FIVE wireless headsets around the same time for my office workers.  One tried to get it to work, and finally gave up.  She kept getting a feedback sound in the headset even when not on a call.  I dont know if it was something in the walls making it have feedback, but we couldnt get the problem to stop so she went back to a wired headset.I have been using the headset she had problems with, and i constantly have that annoying pulsing feedback.One of the five just quit working this week.Problems with 2 out of 5 headsets seems like pretty poor odds to me.I will try a different kind next time...if there is a next time.",Neutral
"I've had this headset for many years (at least 5+, but I can't remember exactly when I got it).  I am giving it 4 stars for:-simple set up-great sound quality-solid talk and standby time-comfortable, with a variety of wearing options-durability (still serves its purpose after 5+ years)I am taking away 1 star for 2 reasons:-Over the course of several years, the charger has gotten finicky.  If I don't place the headset in just right, and jiggle it a little to make sure it has a good connection, it doesn't charge.  Not a tremeendous problem except for those rare occassions when I forget to double check when I put it in the charger, and I end up with a dead headset.-There is a very noticeable buzz in the line if you use the phone handset, which means you MUST use the headset.  I've looked at set up, but there is really only one way to connect the wires, so I don't believe there is way to avoid this.  The simple solution is to just always use the headset, which is fine, but......on those occassions where the headset is dead (see above), you're left with no great option.  When that happens, I end up having to use the speakerphone on my phone until the headset is charged again.  Not a really big deal, but then I get people asking ""talk me off speaker phone"", and I have to explain to them that I can't.Since this model is older, the 2 negatives above may have been fixed in more recent models.  Since this unit is still for sale, and apparently people are still buying it, I though I would just write this quick review.One thing to keep in mind.....know what you are getting with this.  If you have a typical desk phone, then you will need to physically lift the handset to answer calls, and physically lower the handset to end calls.  You can get a remote lifter that does the lifting for you, but I've never had one, so I can't comment on them.  I've heard mixed reviews about the remote lifters, but do your own research.  Regardless, just know that for a typical desk phone (i.e. one that is used in a home office, with the phone line going into the phone),  You can't just tap to talk or tap to end the call.  Somebody or something has to raise and lower the handset.  If you have a ""soft phone"" (calls over the inernet), or are in an office environment with a PBX type system, I can't comment.  My experience is stictly in a home office environment.",Neutral
I bought this for my son and this is what he has to say: &34;This is a great case and held my phone waterproof on a whole cold weekend trip. My whole pack got wet and this case kept my phone dry. I would recommend this to anyone who needs  tough waterproof case.&34;,Neutral

"And it was pretty much worth it (if you sign the plan and get the phone for $250). Otherwise it is a little pricey. The gain was enough to make me feel good about buying it though, and my plan was up anyway so no remorse there. It's difficult to tell from this picture if your i95 is any bigger - but it is less bulky. The features are the same but a little better. And of course GPS is nize.",Neutral
"I've glanced at a few reviews and looked at the overall review for this phone, and think it's a little underrated.  I've had a couple weeks to try out mine, and the battery life with my usage is 3-4 days, and I use the phone for short calls about 5 times a day.  The phone doesn't squeak when squeezed, and all of the construction is tight (even the flip screen doesn't wiggle much).  I saw a few complaints about the weight of the phone, and even a complaint about the metal battery panel.  It's called quality, sometimes quality weighs a little, and if the phone makes your pants fall down when it's hooked onto your jeans, buy a belt.  The phone employs java applications, so you can download programs to fit your needs from nextel, at a cost.  You can also get them from third party sites, also ringtones, wallpaper, etc.  The phone uses GPS, can locate your approximate position for free, with software it can give you directions from one location to another for free (navigational software), called telenav.  The quality of the speakers and microphones on this phone is great.  The speakers can be loud enough to hear in different rooms of the house, or quiet enough you can barely hear them.  The sound is crisp, even on direct connect.  Also, an answer to the slams against nextel itself, don't listen to it.  The only problem is their tech support does not operate 24/7,  other than that their customer service is as good as any service based organization I've ever worked with.  This phone is full featured, it isn't exactly a PDA phone, but it's software capability and 65k color screen make it perform many of the same functions as a PDA.  Great phone, if nextel services your area, you won't be disappointed.",Neutral
"I will not hash over the things that many other wrote in their reviews, but mainly will focus on the problems that I've had with this phone over the course of 1 year that I've had it.1) Battery life is not nearly as good as advertised - lasts about 8 hours - but I admit to be using the phone often and need to swap batteries (have an extra one in the charger) because the wire charger would not charge the phone! (another story altogether) However, my cranky old Samsung (a generation prior to e415) used to last 2 full days on an extended battery with same or greater amt of use.2) Familiar problem - phone's earpiece is too quiet.3) Software's pure crap - the phonebook is not only not intuitive, it would save phone numbers under different people's names! No, not my mistake - checked this several times, and then spoke to a sales rep who said that this does indeed occur with this phone.4) Poor reception - the said Samsung had a much better reception in buildings. And it wasn't Sprint service either - T-mobile and Sprint are equivalently bad.5) Setup - very panful to readjust setup options/ringers.Overall, I don't like this phone at all. Very poor fundamentals - but it looks cool and has a (very useless, but still cool) camera.And, judging by Motorolas of my friends (Nextel models aside), I don't think I want to own another Motorola product. When's the new Treo coming out again...?",Neutral

"I'm standing in a room with a TV blasting, just 10 feet away.  Talking to Hertz reservations - they tell me (a) my voice is the clearest one that they have heard all day and (b) they don't hear the TV at all.  I replace this unit with my old earphone.  ""Now your voice sounds muffled"", he said, ""and I hear that TV now loud and clear"".I have other stories like this.  Walking down a busy noisy street - the Etymonic makes my voice clear and there is no noise of traffic or wind.  My old earphone almost seems to exaggerate the background noise.I use the foam ear piece and it is very comfortable and stays in place.  I don't like the hard plastic ear pieces.Nice.",Neutral
"I started using this headset two days ago.  Sound is good.  You can speak at a normal volume level and you will be heard.  I don't use it outside though.  The earplug does give you a sense of being underwater, the way it blocks your whole ear canal.  But that's how it blocks out noise.  I do think for the money there should be some sort of volume/mute control on the cable.  But, I knew there wasn't when I bought it.  My only complaint is that it comes with a case, yet the headset doesn't fit in it without bending the microphone stalk and I'm not comfortable doing that.  It's sensitive equipment, with a filter in the earpiece that I know I'll have to change eventually hence the included tool for same, then it shouldn't be left in the open to collect dust.  Why not give a case that accomodates it and its accessories?UPDATE 4/30/08:  After months of using this headset, I have to say I find it mildly annoying.  You feel like you're hearing something under water, because the thing is so jammed in your ear (it's a little bit violating...).  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone shopping for a headset.  I really bought it because it was so hard to find a headset compatible with my AT&T; 8525.",Neutral
"The sound of this headset is excellent, as advertised.  The trouble is in getting it to stay in place when I move around.  I'm not talking about playing tennis here, I'm talking about driving the car, and having the boom slowly swing downwards away from my mouth.  The ear plug stays in place, and I can still hear, but the boom swings downward from in front of my mouth (pulled by gravity) and then the person I'm talking with can't hear me so well.  The only thing that works for me in this regard is Plantronics, the one the hooks behind your ear lobe, but that one is not noise-canceling, so I can't hear as well when the wind noise gets high in the car.  The ones that hook over my ear hurt me, and the ones that just plug into my ear usually fall out.  This one is better in that it stays in my ear, but having the boom pivot away from my mouth is a real problem.  I tried bending it so it hangs down from my ear and then swings forward to my mouth, but the center of gravity still tries to swing to the lowest point, so I'd not a boom twice as long as this for that plan to really work.",Neutral
"As you can see by the picture, this device has merely an ear canal insert and the microphone and cord just dangle.  It feels a little awkward to me, although if you're not moving it does stay in as long as you've ""pulled your ear back"" while inserting it, which creates a clamp effect between your ear canal and the rubber insert.  The earset itself is light enough to work this way.  The problem is the cable, which drags, gets bumped by clothing, etc, and jiggles things.  You have to clip the cable to your collar for sure, it's not optional like with over-the-ear headsets.  It comes with a little Y-shaped adapter which lets you use it with SKYPE or other PC-based systems.  Interestingly, while this works fine, the earset has a little whistle-y electronic noise with Etymotic that I don't hear (no matter how close I listen) with some other earsets I have.  It's not noticeable once a conversation starts. Overall, for most use, I don't find it's much better than a couple $7 dollar over-the-ear earsets Radio Shack used to stock (no longer do).  It may be, as someone reported, it's way better for wind noise, I haven't tried that.  It comes with a couple fluffy black sponge wind masks for the mike bulb.",Neutral
"I have a BlueParrott, but I keep forgetting to turn bluetooth on, or it is paired with something else so I've been wishing for a wired headset with noise cancelling ability for a long while.  This is it.On my motorcycle you can't hear the engine, and with the windscreen it is good at low speeds (sans windshield - at 30 mph the smaller windscreen starts letting noise through.  You can't hear my stereo blaring.  I would say it is just slightly less able than the BlueParrot - but that might be because the boom doesn't quite reach the corner of my mouth.  But I only have problems if the noise is coming in at just the right angle.It has an isolating insert so it blocks out external noise (you might need an earplug for the other ear in really noisy environments).A few nits:They should have cases for the windscreens - they tend to get squished.  A stereo or dual mono version would be welcome.  The boom could be a bit longer.Only negative is they don't include an iPod/Blackberry/(some)Android 4 conductor 3.5mm adapter, but I already have several.  They have a VoIP adapter.So maybe not perfect, but this is way beyond all the other ""handsfree"" wired headsets I have used, and it isn't that expensive for what it does.",Neutral
"I have bought other USB hubs in the past, and they all failed. plugging in 2 powered devices would make them not work.This USB Hub I have 4 usb powered hard drives and an external DVD burner plugged in and they all work without any problems! This is one of the best Hubs I have found.",Neutral
"It's a nice-looking product. It seems like I would have liked it. But...My unit had an electrical problem. I connected two portable external hard drives, one powered external hard drive, a printer, an external DVD+-RW drive, a mouse and a keyboard. Then I plugged it in.First I noticed my mouse didn't work. So I unplugged it and plugged in another one. ""That's strange, that one doesn't work either,"" I thought. ""Hmmm, and what's that smell?""  Turns out, that smell was a hard drive frying.  Once I figured that out I unplugged everything and waited.After a few hours, when I figured everything would have cooled down, I started testing my devices.  One portable external drive still ""sort of"" works. I can see most of the file structure but copying attempts fail. The powered external hard drive mostly worked for a couple days and then quit. One portable hard drive never worked again. The optical drive still works, occasionally, but typically won't boot. Occasionally the printer works. The mice never worked again. And the keyboard was fine.  Everything's been tested on 3 different PC systems and 1 Linux system.The worst part? Those were my redundant data storage. I lost everything.",Neutral

This guy works great and I am not at all disappointed in performance. I am however a bit disappointed in the design. This has to sit on the corner of my desk and i need plenty of room on both sides to allow the USB cables to plug in. I would have had them design it like a tower with the plugs all on the back one on top of another. That being said, the current design does offer some added stability to keep the hub from falling over. Overall a great performer and a decent design.",Neutral
"I used to be a USB doubter - I thought USB wouldn't catch on.  Was I ever wrong!  Without a hub, I wouldn't have enough USB ports to plug everything in!Over the past several years, I've gotten a number of USB hubs to handle the problem.  I bought a 7-port CyberPower Hub from another vendor to use at work.  It's lasted with day in and day out use for about two years.  One heavy use is that I use a password manager on a USB thumbdrive and it gets plugged in at least twice a day.  The CyberPower hub at work doesn't seem to mind.The hubs at home, and even the USB ports on my motherboards, seem to loosen up and not keep a good grip on the USB thumbdrive.  So, when my home hub flaked out again, I decided to get a hub that I know works, and keeps on working, for use at home.The only drawback to the hub is the LED's on it.  They are a little too bright, and not really all that useful.  However, it's not a problem at work, and at home, the hub is hidden behind a monitor.  I wouldn't want to use it in a bedroom.If you're looking for a reliable hub, this is it.",Neutral
"ok, so this is only a USB 2.0 hub, not a 3.0 hub, but if your computer only supports USB 2 then this is all you need. Plug count/location is as follows:Along the left and right sides (3 per side) It has 6 USB female type A receptacles (this is the bigger USB connector you normally find on a PC)On the front near the bottom, there is a 7th USB type A receptacle  (at the bottom of the unit when it's in the stand) a USB mini type A receptacle (to connect the hub to the computer)and finally on the left side there's a power input for the external power supply.I've had this hub in use for almost a year now and it's held up very well to multiple plug/unplug cycles. The blue LED at the top is unnecessary to indicate power as there are the other green LEDs for each port. I've used the plugs for keyboards, mice, HDDs and thumb drives. I've never had any problems.Overall it a solid and small hub and recommended if all you need is USB 2.0 and up to 7 plugs.",Neutral
"[Apart from minor issues like stability of the ""weighted"" base, this hub has been such a consistent, heavy-duty performer, while holding its price point (just short of 30) for exactly 4 years, that I've had to award it 5 stars (and order the identical model for my wife).  But just in the last 2 months the hub has been behaving completely opposite to expectations.  It goes totally dead with my hard drives, telling me that they're drawing too much power and therefore the hub is shutting them down until I remove them. But even when the hub is naked with the exception of a tiny flash drive, it remains dead, dark and non-communicative.  It comes back to life only when I disconnect the AC power and rely on nothing more than the power supplied by the USB ports.  That's fine, but not what I need with my 1TB (and bigger) hard drives, which until now had been showing on my computer's desktop with each start-up.  I'm about to call a rep in order to get an idea of what's going on and whether there's a fix (could it be Apple's latest update to OSX?  I'll be back pending further info.]I realized I needed a 7-port hub and checked out the D-Link, Kensington, Belkin--the usual suspects.  Then I chanced upon this unlikely contender, looking more like a jukebox in Amazon's picture than a hub.  I was intrigued by the off-beat design and noticed that the price was competitive (though a couple of the others are presently offering rebates, a free flylight, and other sweeteners). Now that I'm looking at the CyberPower USB port ""in person,"" I can provide a few initial impressions:1.  It's a lot smaller than the picture might imply.  Compactness is nice, but you also want a hub that will stay put and that allows sufficient space between adjacent plugs.2.  Although the hub is designed for either vertical or horizontal use, the added and welcome weight of the detachable base makes vertical use the more sensible option.  Otherwise, you've got a lightweight (and fairly generic) loaded-up plug which could easily move around, dislodging the USB mini-plug (a necessary evil except for small cameras) at one end of every USB 2.0 cable.3.  It seems to handle my equipment off of the USB power supplied by the computer, but I still breathe easier using the included AC power adapter. (To the manufacturer's credit, it's one of the slimmer, lighter wall-warts that I've seen.)4.  The flash drive mount is practical (but not unique).  Now I can finally use that old Sandisk thumb drive that formerly was taking up the space of two USB ports.5.  The individual port lights are on all the time and, unlike most hubs, are not indicative of the presence or absence of a USB device.In conclusion, it's a reliable performer and a convenient as well as eye-catching device--providing you go for the vertical look.  If I were to suggest one design improvement, it would be to ""fatten up"" the tower so that it would be wide enough to permit horizontal insertion of USB devices with the hub in vertical position.  Doing so would assure unforced accommodation of all your USB plugs, even the most space-devouring ones.  Biggest ""gripe"": the vertical design is not real stable.  The hub is easily dislodged from the base and bounces around quite a bit.  If I had to do it over, I'd look at the heavy, dome-shaped Kensington.[Revaluation after almost 3 years: I tried the Kensington. It was no more stable but less reliable. So I returned to the CyberPower, but without the base or vertical position.  I velcroed its back side to the wooden surface behind my desktop machine, with printer and two 500GB storage drives inputted to the rear, one USB cable from the front side to the USB of my iMac, and a flash drive connected to the top side of the hub.  Absolutely no problems.  This item continues to rise in both popularity and price because it's so good.  Should it ever fail, I doubt there's any other hub available that could surpass it. Forget the ""cuteness"" factor; this thing is all business.][4 years later: This ""off brand"" hub continues to be an Amazon best-seller while hubs like the Kensington ""round mound"" have fallen off the map, so this one is a proven winner.  Only lately I've had some difficulty with getting it to recognize really large (1TB) hard drives. Before condemning the drive, I going to try some different cables and maybe a call to the manufacturer.  Otherwise, the next step up would be either a 3.0 USB hub or a hub with dedicated switches, permitting you to assign just the power-draining devices to the AC-powered inputs while allowing the other devices (iPods, mouse receivers, flash drives, printers, etc.) to run sheerly on USB power.]",Neutral
"For one, this product is built very cheap. This means that overtime some ports will simply stop working...why? I'm not really sure...perhaps cheap components, and slight bending?Secondly, it does not support charging, and yet it does at the same time. If you plug in say an apple device you'll get an error, but it will charge which again does not make sense.This is not a 3.0 USB hub, it's a 2.0. Many new devices will require you to have 3.0 now or in the near future. For instance, my new webcam hates being plugged into this hub as the performance greatly drops.Lastly: Mine is just about destroyed, because of a slight drink mishap. Nothing seems to be wrong with device other than...it stops working from time to time, and I sometimes have to clean the ports with a small amount of water to get it to work again..just very annoying.- Additional Notes: The Stand is horrible. It won't stay on, especially if you have multiple cords attached that pull in various directions like the power cable. (It falls out easily, it does not snap on, it's basically just a slightly heavy stand that it ""rests"" on top of. (Useless)- It glows neon Blue. Why? I'm not sure. I like it because it matches my setup, but it's very bright, and I'd rather the ""power"" be used towards the other devices.Finally: This device will likely not support 7 devices being plugged in at the same time....I would get 3-4 to work...maybe.... at any given point. Eventually the two bottom ports simply decided to ""not work"" entirely which is completely stupid because I rarely ever used those ports to begin with.

"The Pros:The function and design of this headset are first rate. Right out of the box it was easy to pair with my Motorola v505 phone.It is small and unobtrusiveThe battery life is really good in standby mode, and lasts several hours of talking. (and it does issue warning tones when the battery runs low, plus the phone issues a message saying ""headset signal weak - switch to handset?""The combo belt clip/charger is a really cool idea.  It would have been EVEN COOLER if Jabra had made it compatible with nokia, Moto, and Ericsson phone chargers.  Now I have yet ANOTHER power supply to drag with me on trips....Reception is very good as long as line of sight is unobstructed by anything full of water.  I can pump gas in my car with the phone on the passenger seat or wander all over my hotel suite waving my arms wildly while the phone sits in its charging stand on the desk.  If there is a body in the way (or an aquarium, etc) then the signal drops off (attenuates) dramatically.  In fact, there is a marked difference between putting the phone on the opposite side of your body from the earpiece when carrying your phone in your pocket.  If on the opposite side, the signal degrades noticeably.The Cons:I have been unsuccessful getting it to pair with either my laptop or my PDA however (an HP iPaq 4155).If you have a bluetooth PDA and use BT to Activesync with your PC, it will interfere with this headset while it is ""connected"" (from Activesync's perspective).  You will hear a constant ""crackling"" noise that sounds like the other person is popping popcorn.  It took me a while to figure out.  You don't have to turn off the BT radio on the laptop or PDA, just ""disconnect"" the BT session temporarily while talking.  This is a hassle, but not a killer (one of the reasons for 4 instead of 5 stars)My biggest problem with the unit is that it does not fit my ears without feeling very insecure.  The ""hanging"" design always feels like it is flopping around for me, and if I lean too far to that side, the unit will actually fall off my ear.  There is no way to tighten the fit of the unit; I have already tried different earpieces and positions of the earpieces, but this doesn't help.  This is the reason why I will probably replace this unit with another.  Its a shame, since it is such a nice unit, but the floppiness on my ears is unacceptable.BTW, I am not a midget - I am 5' 10 and weigh 160 lbs.  I have a fairly narrow face, but I think the bigger issue is that I have small earlobes.  If you have small earlobes (rather than pendulous ones) you may want to test fit this unit in a store before buying one here.  I wish I had...",Neutral
"I've had this headset for about a month now and at first I was very satisfied. I like the shape, it's comfortable enough to wear all day (and I wear it from 7:30 a.m. to about 9:00 p.m.), and the battery lasts almost forever. The headset loads into the charger like a knife into its sheath. The charger even has an accessory belt clip so you can carry it with you as a holster for the headset. The sound is loud and clear unless you drive with your windows down, and the ear gel can be adjusted to put the sound right where you want it. So why 4 stars?My only complaint is that aside from being wearable on either ear, this headset is totally NOT adjustable. Perhaps the shape of my face and/or ear is unusual, but the earpiece keeps pulling away from my ear. Add to that the fact that the headset wants to work itself off my ear entirely, and the lack of adjustability is a problem for me. Lest anyone wonder, I'm not a small person and my ears sit stylishly flat against my head.I solved the foregoing problems by cutting a heavy duty paperclip to length, bending it into the appropriate shape, and taping it to the headset with electrician's tape. Then I bent the wire so that the earpiece fits snugly into my ear. As a bonus, the tape adds a little extra bulk around the upper loop of the headset, which helps hold everything in place. Problem solved, but why not engineer some adjustibility in during design?I'd still buy it, no problem there, but I can't give it five stars because the lack of built-in adjustibility is, to me, a definite oversight.",Neutral

I tried connecting it to a spectrum analyzer to check but it doesn't get any signals compared to another cellphone antenna that does receive. I tried emailing Wilson but they weren't any help. Another problem was the cheaply made adapter that connects the proprietary FME connector on the antenna cable and plugs into the MC760. I had to try 3 of them before I got one that would work. The first one had bad threads and wouldn't go on all the way, the second one had a loose center pin that pushed back in when I tried to connect it. The third one finally did fit correctly but there was still no signal. I don't see how Wilson can get away with selling worthless junk antennas like this, they must get a lot of consumer fraud complaints.

"I have been using the HS810 for 9 months now. I was initially very impressed because of the small size and its being relatively stable with a number of different phones.

Within 2 months the plastic case began breaking next to and inside the hinge for the on/off switch.  Did not impact usability so I didn't care.  For the last several months it has been hard to get a good connection witht he charger (several of my colleagues are having similar problems).

"I bought this keyboard when it was first released back in 2005 took it out today to test it with the idea of selling it. But after installing it on my current device (Verizon XV6800 running Windows Mobile 6.1), I decided I liked it too much to sell. I forgot how much I liked this keyboard. I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because of two annoyances:1. The numbers are accessible only through function keys - a bit of a pain. I would have preferred another row of keys. It wouldn't have added that much size or weight.2. When the keyboard is open, it's supported in the middle by what becomes the case and the ends extend on either side like wings. If you are a slow typist, this is fine. But I'm a fast typist and I tend to hit the the keys pretty hard so the keyboard tips from side to side when I type. Really irritating.

"I have infrared (IR) keyboards to use with my Palm Treo 650 and Palm TX. They don't work very well, at least not for me. I had major problems with lag: characters I typed simply didn't make it to the screen.Taking a chance, I bought the Stowaway Bluetooth keyboard . . . and I am very, very impressed.Set-up is very quick and Stowaway's set-up software is simple to use. Reading the short user's manual (not the brief Quick Start) is a must. The learning curve isn't steep, but because the keyboard is intended as a ""universal"" device, tweaks have to be made for using it with Palm or Pocket PC devices.Once set up, the keyboard performs superbly well. Every key I struck showed up immediately onscreen. I have large hands and I was concerned that I would encounter many typos because of my large fingers. I needn't have worried. The keys have a firm touch and the spacing is wide enough to keep typos to a miniumum. Because of the immediate feedback provided by Bluetooth, I felt no tendency to go back and retype because the character didn't show up. I had no idea that the IR keyboard with its lag was causing me to do that so much.Others have commented about instability because the ends of the keyboard are essentially unsupported. At first this struck me as a design flaw, but within a few minutes this is easily compensated for. I had little difficulty with my keystrokes causing the keyboard to rock.Some have also complained about devices slipping off the minimal stand provided. I had no problems with the Treo 650 or Palm TX.Finally a number of people have complained that there is no fifth row for entry of numbers. You have to use a function key + number combination or you can set the keyboard to number lock. If you have to enter a lot of numeric data, the complaints are justified. On the other hand, for people like me who have limited need for numeric entry, it is an inconvenience, but not a major one. I'm happy to trade a fifth row for numerics for the small size of the unit.Construction of the unit is typical for many of today's products. It's plastic with some metal, but overall it does not feel like it is built like a tank. On the other hand, it doesn't feel overy flimsy either. Time and use will tell how well the unit stands up.Overall, this unit makes it eminently possible to use handheld devices like the Treo 650 and Palm TX for serious typing. I was surprised to find that I could type almost as rapidly on this keyboard as I can on a full-sized unit. The Stowaway Bluetooth keyboard is a very slick piece of work and well worth the cost for anyone who wants to use their smartphone or PDA for typing more than a few words.",Neutral

I haven't used it a lot yet, so maybe I haven't figured out the right combination of button presses. But I hate when things don't simply ""work.""The keyboard is fairly solid and certainly easy to type on, especially if you're accustomed to typing on a laptop.

So, I ended up wasting a lot of time on this keyboard that is supposedly ""for Blackberry and other PDA/Handhelds.""By the way, the carton itself does not state that it works with Blackberry devices, only with Smartphones.  A fairly obscure barcode sticker on the back does indicate, in small letters, that it also works for Blackberry.  In my case, though, back it goes, which really is a shame because I like the quality of the item otherwise and I am sure I could have made good use of it.  In the mean time, I guess I'll keep looking.Lastly, I also agree with the other reviewer who vented about the stupid sticker they place on the unit.  It is glued to the keyboard and to the front surface and is quite a pain to remove.",Neutral
"Works great with my Moto Q.  Typing sound is annoying but easily turned off.I also caution that you should probably store the batteries uninstalled.  I put a brand new set of Duracells in it and they were dead a month later with almost no use (Just sitting in my briefcase)  I discovered this at the start of a 5 hour flight and fortunately was able to cannibalize a set from my MP3 player.  This only happened once so I can't say for sure that the keyboard sucked them dry.What really annoyed me was the ""Fold and unfold"" sticker which had some sort of industrial adhesive.  What a stupid thing to use.  It took me 25 minutes with cleaning solvent to get that darn thing off.  Also the black vinyl zippered pouch stinks like some toxic chemical.  If not for those two things I'd rate it 5 stars",Neutral
"Long battery life, connects quickly to phone. Phone callers can't even tell I am on a BT headset, no complaints of inablility to hear my voice will on a call. It is not for people with wide necks, does not stretch much. Can slide back when active and the earphones are not in your ears. Otherwise light, controls are easy to reach and distiguish. I have the similar LG HBS730 but prefer these due to the ease of finding the buttons you want but prefer the flexible neck of the LGs.",Neutral
"I have had an LG-700 for a few years, and I love it.  But I get complaints from people about the microphone picking up extraneous noises when I am on the phone in a supermarket, or working in the kitchen, so when it started to wear out, I tried this one.  Well....this does have pretty good sound, BUT, the rigid frame for the ""yoke"" is a problem for this guy with a 17.5"" neck.  And the location of the on/off switch is annoying (on the back).  Plus, whereas the LG-700 has 6 buttons, this has 4, and the buttons are sorely missed for all of the needed functions of such a headset.  I often get the ""Equalization changed"" message when I am trying to get Siri to pop up...very annoying!  On the plus side, it does seem to connect to my iPhone quickly, and the signal seems pretty stable.All in all, it is nice...but misses in a few ways.****************Update:  After 3 weeks, I returned this to Amazon.  The fit was just too annoying.  Thank you Amazon, for your great return policies!",Neutral
"I have been a fan of the LG HBS series since the amazingHBS-700and also own theHBS-730and the newHBS-800.With the SF500, Motorola has clearly taken a more than close look at the HBS series and attempted to improve on it. Here's how I find these two compare:- Battery life: Moto wins. This thing keeps on going, and lasts even longer than the already amazing HBS-730. Too bad the remaining battery life estimator is so inaccurate (it reports 4 hours remaining on a full charge, when it's much closer to 10)- Convenience and durability: Moto wins again. The Buds sit tight around your neck and don't bounce. The cords are not as fragile on the LGs, and the magnets holding the earbuds are much stronger on the Moto Buds. Unlike the HBS-730 and 800, the Buds do not report their power level to the Bluetooth host (the iPhone shows a little bar next to the bluetooth icon indicating the battery status when you use the LG headphones). That's funny since the older SF600 have the feature.- Ergonomy: LG wins big time. The button layout and functionality are intuitive and logical on the LG, and completely convoluted and inconvenient on the Buds; on the Buds, the same button is used for FF (one press) or REW (two presses); also, the power button on the LG is a sliding switch, whereas the Buds use an electronic switch which makes it much more difficult to find out if your headset is on or off.- Sound quality: I would rate the Buds somewhere between the 700 and the 730; mostly, they lack bass and presence.- Range: excellent, but the outlandish 150ft range advertised is only available when connected to a Bluetooth Class 1 device, and these are rare -- only featured on a few Motorola phones as far as I could tell. When connected to a Class 2 device (which most devices are) the range is 33ft like all other devices; I think Motorola is a little disingenuous when advertising this extended range.In conclusion... They're not bad, and if the LG series didn't exist they would deserve 5 stars. However, considering they're a blatant rip-off of a successful concept, it's disappointing that Motorola improved on some of the flaws of the HBS series (mostly the cord durability and the magnet strength) but failed to pick up on the ergonomy (button layout, power switch).Which one should you pick? in my opinion, the cheapest one you can find, unless you need to connect to two devices, in which case the Moto Buds or the HBS-800 are a must; and if you easily get irritated and confused by complicated controls, stay away from the Buds.Recommended, but they're not the LG HBS-series killer that Motorola probably designed them to be.",Neutral

"My LG HBS-730 that I use for bike rides with no problem.  Recently, the route I took has a lot of interference from the near by power lines and tower.  Music from LG glitches so much that I can't enjoy my music anymore.  I also have a Plantronics BackBeat Go 2.  This one is a little bit better, but my music still glitches and break up at the area with the most interference.  My phone is a Samsung Galaxy S4 Active and it's stored in my bike jersey back pocket, which is less than two feet from the headset.Before I try this unit, I went and try a LG HBS-750 (one user review said it has less interference).  HBS-750 was worst.  It started to break up even before I enter the interference area.I finally give this one a try.  Wow, I don't know what kind of power they use, I had three rides so far and I haven't experience one single glitch yet.  No music break up, no phone call conversation break up.  It's so nice to finally have some uninterrupted music.I problem I had was that once time, I receive a phone call and the party on the other side couldn't hear me.  I don't know if it's the other party or the headset.  The party calls me back and this time, when I press the pickup button, the headset doesn't respond with button push.The sound is very awesome as well.  I say the bass is better that the HBS-730.  The magnet is stronger as well.  I like it when I tuck the unit behind my shirt and when I am not using the ear plug and let it dangles, it naturally falls down and attached itself back to the magnet of the unit ... through my shirt.  This keep the earplug from swinging back and forth when I am not using it.  I don't know if this is by design or just accident.  Either way, it's cool.",Neutral
This bluetooth did not last me a year.  I called Motorola for a replacement.  They sent another model and I've been using it for four years now.,Neutral
"When I first received this product it worked well.  After a month and a half it stopped communicating with my cell phone. I called Motorola and they told me it was guaranteed for a year and to send it back to them. The model I bought is no longer sold and they have a new one out now. They told me they will replace the blue tooth. It has been over 3 weeks since I mailed it in and I have yet to hear anything. I am happy with the blue tooth technology. But I am not happy with Motorola. They have never contacted me since I called them about the prolems I was having and have not even taken the time to e-mail be they received my old one (which I know they have by my shipping receipt I got back). My blue tooth may have been a lemon but Motorola's customer service is not up where it should be. I am still waiting for a replacement to come in. In the meantime I am using the free plug-in type I received when I bought my phone.  My advice is Buy a Bluetooth, just be careful who makes it and check out their customer service.",Neutral
"It's a great deal, so i jumped on it. But was truly disappointed. I've so far summed up Motorola products as well really really poor. I own a Razar, wish i could return that! But this headset, thinking it's from motorola would work well with my phone, but no. It's on my belt clip, and the phone tell me that the bluetooth headset is 30 ft away, signal is weak, and then disconnets. To me that's strange. It's also surprising that this happens randomly, so it's kinda annoying, b/c you can't anticipate it. Kinda annoying when driving, b/c you rely on the headset to work properly. Also get the static noise which is weird, b/c it shouldn't do that. especially when driving.",Neutral
"I've used a number of Bluetooth headsets and this is among the worst. The sound quality is low, especially outdoors, and there is quite a bit of static even when within a few feet of the phone. The volume is poor - even with the volume cranked up to the top I could barely hear the other party indoors and outside (with any background noise) it was almost impossible. This is the result of the earpiece resting outside the ear rather than within the ear (earbud style). The microphone is far enough from one's mouth that it is difficult for the person with whom you are speaking to hear you.The fitting of the earpiece is also slightly uncomfortable, especially if you wear glasses, but not as bad as some others I've tried. It does not flop around much under normal circumstances. I was also disappointed that this uses a proprietary power connector rather than mini-USB like the older H500, which would have made it easier to charge with the same charger as my Razr.I thought this headset would be adequate for the price, but for someone who is serious about using a Bluetooth headset on a regular basis I'm going to recommend either the Jabra BT500 or BT250. I've used those in the past and found them much better overall, and worth the extra price.",Neutral
"I used have one of this earpeice 2 years ago and I lost it, so I ordered this since this is much much cheaper than my previous one.Different from the previous peice, this item came in with extremely cheap package and it's sound quality is worse than my previous one. My friends complained about the ECHO and noise sometimes so I suspect if this is actually a refurbed one. Sometimes the manufacturer sell such items for much less with simplized packaging.",Neutral
"The voice reception with this headset was just ok. Sometimes people on the other side had trouble hearing me sometimes especially when driving. I also get a tingling sensation around my ear and a mild ache in the outer part of my ear everytime I use it. It may be something to do with  the design of the head set. Research has never proved any connection between using wireless or bluetooth and the impact on your nerves/brain, and I have to believe them...It's weird though that I get always get a tingling, achy sensation if I use a cell phone continuously for more than an hour but with the bluetooth I get the same sensation in about 20 minutes. So try as I might, I cannot wear it for prolonged periods of time. After I used this headset for about 2 months it just died on me! I used to charge it once every week and never left it on the charger for long periods - only till the blue light went off to show it had finished charging. I did this as other reviewers had warned against over-charging. However, now the headset just died...after 2 months. I called Motorola and they agreed to replace it. It takes about 10-14 days from the time you send it in to get a new one. I'm waiting for the replacement to come back. Who knows how long this one will last!",Neutral
"I bought this headset for probably the same reason most people did, the price. For 30 bucks and from a reliable company you can't go wrong. I got what I paid for. The sound quality and the mic quality are both decent, enough at least for someone who isn't obsessive about how crystal clear the reception is. It has a tendency to drop the connection sometimes for no apparent reason, annoying at times, but not very common.About a month after use, it stopped working for no explicit reason. I sent it back and got a replacement from Motorola. However only a month or so after that, I seemed to have misplaced it, and had pretty much thought it was lost.Today, about a month and a half later, I found it, in my dryer. Apparently it had been in the pocket of one of my jeans that I hadn't washed for a while and it went through a whole wash and dry cycle. Happy that I found it, but I all but gave up on it to work again. I gave it a shot anyway, and lo and behold, it did start charging. So after an hour I tried pairing it with my phone, and voila, IT STILL WORKS! I was stunned. Not only that a bluetooth headset could go through that abuse and still function like new, but a headset that seems relatively cheap and outdated!So based on my first experience it was a 2, but any piece of electronic equipment that can survive a wash and dry HAS to get two more stars in my book. Reliable, and saved me from shelling out more money for a more expensive replacement. It gets the job done.",Neutral

I bought this from Amazon. I linked quickly and worked as advertised.  I found the various button modes difficult to keep track of and found it a real problem over time.My biggest complaint is that this device is too too quiet at maximum volume.  Obviously Motorola did not test their design in a car that had some road noise.  I found it only adequate in a quiet room.  I suspect it is the fact that the speaker is a long way from the ear canal.  I am wondering if an in ear type will be better in the long run.Save you money on this one if you plan to use it in a car.  It is fine if your sitting in quiet room.,Neutral

"The concept of the phone is terrific.  I have to use a 2-way pager for work, and instead of carting around a cell phone and bulky pager, I now just have this one small item.  And while I didn't think I'd really use it, the Bluetooth functionality has definitely sold me.  I can use it not only for a wireless headset, but to connect to the internet and to transfer sound files back and forth as well.The software of the phone seems to be a bit buggy still, unfortunately.  When I lock the keypad, I still sometimes hear tones when the keypad is pressed and the display lights up.  The menus are sometimes slow to respond, delaying as much as 2 full seconds (doesn't sound like much, but it can be irritating).Overall, I'd buy the phone again without hesitation, but I'm an early adopter.  If you're willing to put up with the occassional buggy behavior, I'd definitely recommend this phone.",Neutral
"If you have large hands ( like me ) you will find the keyboard difficult to use. I had particular difficulty with the 5-way directional button. No matter how carefully I used the button I ended up hitting the adjacent buttons too. I also had problems using the camera feature because of it's tiny size. However, in the interest of full disclosure, I am a bit of a klutz. I was also displeased to find that the unit's limited memory made any real web browsing impossible. Also, there appears to be no Bluetooth compatibility with Macs. It will sync with the use of a data cable ( a separate purchase required ), but I think it's a shame to spend the extra bucks for Bluetooth only to find it is of limited use.What made me decide to return the phone was that I found the signal to be weaker than any other cell I have ever owned. We live in a little valley that compromises the signal of any cell phone, but the A630 couldn't establish a solid connection.It's a great looking device and it feels very well built.

"We've had the Sidekick II for about two months.  Although my 11-year-old likes it for its buttons and Gee Whiz value, I find it very awkward to use as a phone.  It doesn't have a normal keyboard, so you must flip the screen up to press the keys, then flip the screen back down to listen and talk.  When you get into a voicemail situation, you have to keep flipping the screen up to ""press 1 for English"", etc.  Very annoying.You also must pay an additional $20 per month if you want to browse the Internet, use Instant Messaging, or even Download Fun.  Otherwise, all you get is phone calls and text messaging (which is also extra).  Even the non-sidekick phones let you get T-Zones for Instant Messaging as a $5.00 option.Another gripe is that the phone is falling apart after two months of not very rough usage.  The screen no longer slips into place when flipped open and the letter ""A"" has fallen out.  It occasionally just freezes for no reason. The first phone I received froze up the first day and had to be replaced.The battery is built into the phone, so you can't take it out to let the phone reset itself.  No such thing as having an extra battery on a trip, for example.Internet browsing is cool, but so slow you think it stopped working.  I think some of the fault is just the slow connection, but the other part of the fault is that the phone seems to take a long time to actually build the web page it's trying to display.Oh, yeah.  Another problem is that T-Mobile expects you to pay $9.95 to set up your album on its web site, then 29 cents for each photo you upload to it.The phone is too large and heavy and has poor quality voice reproduction.  You can't use wallpaper and the ring tones sound terrible.Although it looks good on paper, it isn't really ready for prime time.",Neutral
"Sidekick II is meant to be your one-stop-shop wireless gadget for e-mailing, web-browsing and IM chatting anywhere you go.  You can also download limited content.  You can also sync with your Outlook calendar and addressbook, but only if you pay extra for a third-party utiltiy program.  Compared to the original Sidekick, SK II is thinner but quite a bit longer.  I also think it's uglier, esp. the new thumb keyboard, but the keyboard is still very useable.  Battery life is terrible after the first couple weeks, requiring you to carry the charger with you all the time.The problem with the whole T-Mobile data service, though, is the poor quality of T-Mobile's GPRS coverage.  T-Mobile is infamous for its sporadic GSM (voice) coverage in the U.S.  When it comes to GPRS (data), it's even worse, and the slightest degradation in reception will cause the Sidekick to go kaputt.  And when that happens, SK has a tendency to fail to re-establish the data connection when signal strength returns.  This makes a very frustrating user experience, esp. when you need Internet access the most (e.g., when you want to log onto amazon.com to compare-shop that big Sharp Aquos LCD TV you are looking at inside a Best Buy store).  Unfortunately, T-Mobile has not improved its coverage or download speed, so if you get the SK, be prepared for slow speed and lost connections.  Once the novelty factor wears off, the SK experience is a rather stressful one.Of course, currently no other device - not even the Treo 600 - has the same portable form factor and useable keyboard as the SK II.  If you are an absolutely Internet junkie, you'll probably find T-Mobile's abysmal coverage tolerable and SK's true wireless Internet access appealing.",Neutral

"Got this headset to replace my Jabra (which was incompatable with my Nokia 3650). Fit and comfort is extremely subjective but I found the Jabra to be far more comfortable (I would actually forget I was wearing it); that said, this unit is not uncomfortable (until after a couple hours) just not nearly AS comfortable or securely fitting.Very few complaints as far as performance. It was easy to pair with my phone, my wife's Motorola V3 and even my laptop. Sound quality is clear for both parties (recipients occasionally complained of a pinging noise with the Jabra) and the noise reduction actually works to eliminate wind noise. Battery life is excellent. The single function can be a little aggrevating (especially when trying to turn it off as you have to hold it down for a long time). The only weird and very rare quirk is occassionally calls will be interrupted with a strange sound that sounds like someone dropping a manhole cover as it spins on pavement - very strange, very annoying and fortunately very rare.Overall, performance is top notch, comfort is acceptable and value is difficult to beat.",Neutral
"This device allows me to answer incoming calls on my NEC phone while I roam the office with my Plantronics wireless headset in place. This headset already has enough wireless range to cover half the floor in my building, so the ability to answer the phone at such a distance is extremely useful in a bunch of situations. A couple of key features:When a call comes in, either Intercom or from an external line, there is a chime in my ear that alerts me to the call. I can then press the single button on the headset and the receiver is lifted, allowing me to receive the call.When the call is done, I press the single button again and the receiver hangs up.It's about as simple as conceivably possible.The install instructions were however less than perfect. To get this to work properly, I have to unplug the phone base from the handset and in to the Plantronics unit. The handset is then plugged in to the Plantronics unit. This was not explicitly stated in the install instructions. It took 10-15 minutes to figure out the trick. Once that was worked out however, everything has been perfect.The only thing that I cannot easily do is pick up parked calls as there is no function to select a line. I can live with that shortcoming.",Neutral
I used this phone lifter in combination with the Plantronics CS50 Wireless Office Headset.  It was a powerful combination that allowed me to answer my phone up to 300 feet away from my office. This lifter fits onto your phone base and lifts the receiver when you press a button on your remote headset.  You can answer the phone or hang-up when the call is completed without ever touching the receiver.The lifter came with a plug in mini-microphone ring detector that attached to my base phone and it allowed the base station to notify me when the phone was ringing.  The setup was quick and easy and the device took up almost no space on my desk as it attached to my phone.I spent thousands of hours a year on the phone and this device along with my remote wireless headset saved me a lot of neck stress and phone holding for hours a day.  This is a useful tool in any modern office and I recommend it to you.,Neutral
"This device takes a signal from a wireless headset like the CS540 and lifts up the receiver from your base phone unit. Depending on your phone's angle and the conformation of the receiver, it may work or not. My phone is a Toshiba digital phone and I was able to get this to work only by angling the phone almost horizontally, which makes it look stupid on my desk and also makes it hard to read the LCD and caller ID.Installing it is a bit twitchy, as you have to temporarily mount it somehow on the side of the phone as you play with where it is to sit, and if it's angled correctly. That's because the stickum adhesive is pretty permanent, so you have to decide the optimum  placement before you attach it. I had to resort to duct tape for this step.I'm going to be frank and say I have a love-hate (maybe mostly hate) relationship with Plantronics equipment. I go through headsets lately like nobody's business. My first one lasted 10 years! That was excellent. But the next one lasted 2 minutes (an M22) which only lasted that long because I tap danced on it before I threw it in the trash. The latest is a CS540 which I will review once I have one that doesn't arrive DOA. That's right, dead out of the box. I got it overnight shipped, only to diagnose a bad cable from receiver to amplifier (which will take a week to get replaced.) Nice! Overnight emergency turns into a tech job for me, plus a week's wait. I put all this stuff in the review, because I'm not sure Plantronics deserves their top spot in telephone headset and accessories. We're pretty much stuck using them and I see the quality going down over the years. This lifter is case in point; it's not the swiftest design imaginable. The little extender rod/gripper that is your last-ditch method to get your receiver to hang up is a kludge, in my opinion. Perhaps you've had better results, but I find this thing less than perfect.",Neutral

"I could not be more impressed. I was highly skeptical as I have been buying bluetooth headsets like crazy trying to find one that worked, and they're all pretty much junk. This thing worked all the way out to the sidewalk, and likely much further, but that's as far as I went. The quality on the other end is very clear. The manual is plain stupid, it looks like they were half way through putting it together when they released it, but on the Mac the manual was of course not needed, just plug it in and it worked without any of the driver install nonsense Windows requires. BTW, I am using it primarily with Skype.OK, I have to add something to this review. There's a fatal flaw in this device. A flaw that makes the device near worthless to me now. If the USB cable is unplugged, but the earpiece is left clipped into the holder/charger, the battery runs down within hours. Obviously a simple diode somewhere would have prevented this, but for me the device now is close to useless.Update: May 8th 2011.

I was told to call Palm in India, which I did, and they told me the keys were not covered under warranty.I truly wish I were making this up, because I have really loved Palm.  This is my fourth Palm device, though it will likely be my last.  I run a small real estate company which works with wireless telecom providers throughout the nation.  My hope for this device was that I could stop carrying three devices (my cell phone, my Palm T3 and my laptop).  And then, that all my guys could stop carrying all these devices around.Of course, when I took the phone to Sprint, they said it was Palm's responsibility to repair.  When I raised a stink with them they just looked at me with blank eyes, as they always do.  Sprint seems like they are in the business of trying to run customers off.I called India back and raised enough of a stink, that they said they would give me - this one time - a ""free return and repair,"" meaning I would be without my phone for 5-10 business days. They also gave me the option of paying them an additional $25 to get a refurbished replacement, complete with a 90-day warranty (which I now know means nothing).  These people honestly acted like they were doing me the biggest favor by offering me this repair.I was then effectively called a liar by Palm / India when I had to re-emphasize that the keys just don't work, and that I needed something immediately.  I don't understand how I can be made to feel like a criminal when I deal with these people, or how I can be made to feel like they're doing me a favor by standing behind their product.  I am the customer!  Doesn't that mean anything anymore?I am also not sure I understand how customer service in general has become so bad (though Amazon's remains very, very good).  When a person spends $400 on a phone, or any device, it should work longer than a few weeks.  But when it does stop working, the company that sold it should stand behind their product, instead of looking for ways to squirrel out of their responsibility.  Subsequent to this occurrence, other friends / colleagues have told me how they had problems with their Treo 650s, as well.There are other issues with this phone.  Out of the box, the power/sync cord did not work.  I returned that to Sprint and got a tremendous hassle in trying to get it replaced.  (I ended up buying a Seidio charger/cradle, which works fine.) The sound is pretty bad - I am constantly having to adjust the volume.  Every so often, the phone just resets itself - can't figure this one out at all.  Also, when someone calls in on Call-Waiting, you cannot disconnect your active call without disconnecting the incoming call; in other words, when you accept the Call-Waiting call, it automatically means two calls will run simultaneously, even when the first party hangs up.  This plays heck on your monthly minutes.Also, there are limited, non-intuitive ways you have to power on the phone.  And don't get this phone for its camera: cell phone cameras are only good for placing pictures on that cell phone.Otherwise, all the Palm applications work as they should, and as they have for the past number of years.  Expect nothing new and different from the Palm OS part of the Treo.All in all, I am firm in my opinion that I will never own another Palm device.  My company will stop using Palm, and we are going to slowly migrate away from Sprint (when contracts start to expire).My apologies for the rant, but it simply seems that these companies have become much bigger than their customers.  Excuse me if I just let them move on without me.Are there any companies out there that provide good customer service anymore?  I know mine tries to; otherwise, we're out of business.",Neutral
"I purchased the Scala 500 as my first BT headset and I regret it. The company is v-e-r-y slow to respond to email messages to their support box, so call them, don't write.While the sound quality of the unit is very, very good, there are other issues with the unit. First, the fit on my particular ear is horrible... always feeling like it was going to fall off. I never trusted it walking through airports as it just didn't feel secure.Second, the unit literally fell apart in my hands after three or four months. The portion that protrudes gently into my ear came loose, then broke off. I note that others have metioned the same thing. It just wasn't well constructed. Bummer! I've replaced it now with another low-cost unit made by Plantronics, but while I miss the sound quality of the Cardo, I am disappointed by their slow support and poor quality.",Neutral
"Works well even in the wind.  Can't listen to music through it with my SLVR though, as expected.  I find I don't use it much though.I set up a shortcut in my SLVR for quickly enabling bluetooth when I am wearing my headset. If I have a bluetooth headset active, it refuses to play music at all - through the built-in speaker or a cable.  But this is the fault of the SLVR.Update:  I dropped it outside, where it got rained on for two days before I found it.  Thoroughly dried it out and turned it on.  Still works!",Neutral
"I am using this device with a Polycom landline phone.Trying the 3 settings I can get a decent connection on my end with a separate Bluetooth earpiece, where I hear the other party fine with little noise and no echo.But on the far end, even landline to landline, there is an annoying whine and some echo, no matter what the setting.  This isn't good enough, I prefer to use the corded headset.I am returning this product to Amazon.",Neutral
"I bought, exchanged, and then returned this unit.  Both units delivered to me would not turn on.  When I charged them using the supplied adaptor, the red charging light came on and a few hours later, the unit was supposedly fully charged.  However, when I attempted to turn the unit on by pressing the power button, nothing happened.  The unit never came on, could not be paired, and never worked.  I returned both of them.  I can understand one unit being bad, but two units that were shipped several weeks apart shouldn't be.When I called for technical support, I waited on hold for sometime, and then gave up.",Neutral
"It was because I could no longer obtain good quality BL-5C's that I finally gave up my Nokia phone.I think the last battery I tried in it was one of these, it actually had worse performance than the battery I had used for a year and was trying to replace.These might be phonies from China or just so old that they are chemically inert, but I am afraid I can't recommend these.",Neutral
"Got this is a timely mannor, put it in my phone, chatged for 12+ hours and nothing ! Never worked ! Annoyed to say the least !

A lot of good it did me.",Neutral
"I bought this Bluetooth as a back-up for my pretty pink Motorola H500. Therefore, I placed it in the drawer until I needed a replacement, and last night i needed it. I plugged it up for a couple of hours and tried to pair it to my new phone and it did not work. I then charged it overnight and again tried to pair it and nothing (not one indicator light). I plugged the blue-tooth back into to the charger, it had a steady blue light and i tried pairing it to my phone while it was on the charger and it worked; unfortunately, i can not walk around with a charger and outlet attached to my head. Consequently, this was a lemon and due to the months passed from my internet purchase, i am unable to return it or exchange.Therefore, the moral of the story is to test everything you purchase from the internet. I learned a valuable lesson.",Neutral
The device was not as the description. It looked as if someone dropped it off their vehicle and it hit the road and skidded all the way down. I was VERY disappointed when opening it b/c it was the first thing I seen other than the front damage.I did email the seller and told them and they were very nice and refunded me as I returned the product back to them.,Neutral
I bought an H500 a few years ago when it first came out. It was plagued with low volume and poor connection. After using a nokia bluetooth for the last year I got this one again because of the no cell phone laws in California as of July 1st.This headset is plenty loud with my Sony Ericsson T650i and I haven't had it drop the bluetooth connection yet. The volume sits a little below half and I can hear perfectly in the car. Battery life rocks and voice clarity is a lot better than I remembered it with the first H500.4 out of 5 stars because the ear clip is flimsy and doesn't allow the H500 to sit tightly against your ear. So if you're planning on using this while running or during an intense walk - don't count on it.Definitely recommend this as a great bluetooth device. Can't go wrong with the price!,Neutral
"This Bluetooth sucks. Plain and simple... I mean I paid, what, $15 for the thing so wasn't expecting the best but at least working quality. I always buy the Motorola H730 or H750 which are upwards of $60 but I always lose them. Always! It is a curse so I figured I would get a rinky-dink cheap one so I wouldn't cry in the corner losing out on a day&8217;s worth of work pissed and distraught over losing my (what is this my 6th) Bluetooth. But with every call - EVERY ONE - it was unbearable static on my end so much so that everyone mentioned it. Hell, even the recorded lady on the voicemail was like this thing sucks! So yeah just spend the extra cash and go up a few grades because this was a lost cause.",Neutral
"I'll start with the bad first, given the amount of interest this phone has generated.1) The Phonebook application is a little...wonky. Some people have said you can't add more than one piece of contact info per contact, which is NOT true. You can, but its nearly hidden underneath the ""MORE"" function while editing the contact. However, its not convenient and you cannot add additional e-mail addresses or phone numbers to your contacts using the Phone Tools app...which is annoying, since T-Mobile charges $30-40 for the hardware/software bundle.1a) It also takes forever to scroll through your Phonebook contacts. I thought it MIGHT be caused by having some SIM contacts, so I transfered all of them to phone memory. No dice. The scroll speed is untenable. Even my wife's Moto V330 is quicker. What gives? I had to create a voice prompt for almost every contact in my list.2) Even at full blast, the volume just isn't loud enough. Plus, the ""audio sweet spot"" on the speaker is hard to keep next to your ear. If you are planning to get a Bluetooth headset and use that exclusively, this shouldn't keep you from getting the phone.3) Compared to a Samsung V205, a Sony Ericsson P910i and Motorola's own V330, the RAZR gets poorer reception. The previous phones mentioned all get four bars at my house. The RAZR gets 2. This even after calling T-Mobile tech support for help. Their advice? ""Keep turning the phone on and off and it will hopefully find another tower.""4) T-Mobile offers NO games for this phone yet. Given how high profile this form factor has become, I find this level of support to be somewhat poor. I know - you don't buy a phone for its games. But just to show how lacking T-Mobile's support is...the RAZR includes a demo for BeJeweled. After the (very) short demo is over, it asks if you want to buy it. Clicking the link brings you to a webpage that says ""Sorry, we don't offer games for your phone yet"". My wife's V330 has a similar issue. She's had it for over 4 months and services like T-Mobile STILL offer no games for the phone. Again, I know you shouldn't buy a phone based on the number of games offered for it, but its still a feature, something to whittle away the time while waiting at the DMV.5) Camera phone still only 640x480. Decent pics at that resolution, but given that there are cheaper phones on the market (I didn't get this phone for free) with higher pixel values, this is a moderate oversight on Moto's part6) Phone response is fairly poor as well. Example - going through my contacts by pressing keys (going from Q to R to S)...so very slow. You think the phone hasn't responded so you mash the button again, at which point it responds to TWO button presses and you have to start all over again.7) The Phone Tools application is a little user unfriendly and totally geared to people who mess around with Outlook CSVs on a daily basis. I've managed to get it to work, but not without some work.Alright, so now for the good.1) This phone is a veritable conversation piece. Oohs and ahhs all around...if you care about that sort of thing. I usually don't. I just want a functional phone that gets good battery life, gets a decent signal and can withstand a beating (I'm a klutz). But if you do care about the conversation-worthyness of your cell phone, this one has it in spades.2) Great battery power. I've had it on for 5 days at moderate usage and I've still got 2 bars left.3) This is a sturdy phone. My kid has already dropped it on cement twice and I've seen NO scratches at all. Maybe I'm lucky, as another reviewer mentioned that poor build quality on his piece. I've not had any issues. The phone is rock solid.4) The usual amount of ringtones and wallpapers....all of which are amazingly expensive. Why does it cost 2 bucks for a hi-fi ringtone lasting 20 seconds when I can buy the song at iTunes for a dollar?5) The PhoneTools software allows you to create your OWN ringtones. I haven't played around with the software yet, so I'm going to guess that your abilities to import MP3s or CD-audio will be truncated to some degree.6) Excellent Bluetooth performance. Haven't had the opportunity to test file transfers and such, but the RAZR's connection to my Moto BT headset is great. Doesn't matter which side of my body they are situated. Decent sound quality even at 20 feet of unobstructed space.7) Did I mention this phone is attractve?8) Ringtones can get quite loud, even without degrading ringtone sound quality. I wish the speaker was this loud.This phone has some serious shortcomings - most important among them is the poor performance of the Phonebook app, poor signal quality and low speaker volume. Ordinarily, I'd be bringing the phone back, like, tomorrow. But the design of the phone and its excellent BT performance makes me want to hang onto it.Hopefully, Moto learns from their mistakes and releases a RAZR V4 with better earpiece volume and snappier response times.",Neutral
"The 1 reason to buy (and keep) this phone is the slim form factor.  Let's face it - for guys who don't like to keep the phone on their belt like a pager, a pants or suit pocket is the only option.  This phone is far and away the best one in that regard.  I forget it's there a lot of the time.  It is also built EXTREMELY solidly, and does NOT scratch easily, although the SCREEN scratches easily.However, the battery life is terrible.  I literally have to charge it every night after less than two hours of talking with bluetooth.  You MUST get the car charger immediately.  Even though I had bought one on the internet, I couldn't wait for it because the phone kept dying so I raced to a local cingular store for an intermediate car cord.The Motorola HS-850 BT headset is great but occassionally loses connection w/the phone, which is frustrating.The only reason I kept this phone is the size.",Neutral
"My wife and I each purchased V551s with our migration to Cingular 6 months ago. In that time (during which the phone was never dropped, bumped, etc), I've replaced my phone twice, and hers once. The problems we've had include:- random ""white screen of death""- Bluetooth connectivity problems (isolated to phones)- dropped calls in perfect reception areas- random battery indications- the infamous ""Unable to Charge"" problemAdd to that Motorola's lousy phonebook and UI, and retarded Bluetooth handling (e.g., if any BT device is connected, the same Moto default ring sounds, regardless of sound profile or caller-specific ringtones), and you have an overpriced, overhyped, oversize paperweight.I'm fortunate Cingular offers my company's employees discounts on new phones, so that I can go back to Sony Ericsson. My old T616 gave me 2 years of perfect service, even after having been dropped twice. It's on its 2nd owner now, who has used it for 6 months problem-free.",Neutral
"My chief complaint with this phone is that the Ringtone selector is accessible from the outside of the phone which causes it to be changed when simply handling it or fiddling with it in your pocket. There have been numerous times where i have missed calls because it was inadverdantly set to silent just from being pulled out of my pocket! The rest of the complaints are from the poor and confusing Motorola software and menu structure. This phone does quite a bit but rarely can i find how to access these features even after months of ownership and i have owned several other Motorola phones before. I often am talking and am buried in some inscrutable set of menu's when i am trying to do something else like activate bluetooth or find a number in the phonebook The software is also slow and unresponsive compared to Nokia or Samsung which gives it a lazy and inexact feel. Some of the pluses are the rubberized finish which is easy to grip, full support for bluetooth (although bluetooth sucks up so much battery power that it becomes borderline useless) and nice large well lit keys and crisp screen.The phone has an overall feeling of solidity without being too heavy or clumsy feeling. I have gotten more drops on this phone than any other but i have never used cingular before so i don't know whether its the service or phone. Overall i want to like the phone but i'm searching for something else as the frustrations arent worth it.",Neutral
"I screwed up; shouldn't have ordered this; it's of no use to me.  Since the real price was hidden in the ""shipping and handling"" it's pointless to return it; I'll just write it off as an ""educational expense"".I actually bought this to use on a cordless handset that had a ""hands free"" 2.5mm jack. (Siemens cordless phone system).  The owners manual says ""...any 2.5 mm headset"", so that's what I bought.  I don't even know where this thing is anymore; I put it back in the little bag and forgot about it.I tried it on three of the handsets in the system; the plug simply captures the line and makes a loud, ""screeching"" sound...  ...playing with the plug, I can find one tenuous position about a quarter of the way out where I can hear audio from the phone, but the moment I let it slip it goes back to the screeching.I can't get it to work on anything else either including my wife's Samsung Intensity (which also has a 2.5mm headset jack; same results), but I don't have access to a PalmEvery so often I do something stupid; buying this was one of those occasions.",Neutral

"This is the 3rd ""OEM"" battery I bought via Amazon Marketplace -- as with the others, it was terrible. I ordered form the OEM shop a BR50. They sent a BR56 which is supposed to be even better with 3 hours talk time. It did not last 30 minutes after a complete overnight charge. Nowhere as long as the battery I am trying to replace which lasts over an hour instead of the original 2 1/2 hours.OEM sent a counterfeit fake battery --- not OEM. How can you tell? Because Motorola OEM batteries are made in Japan. These say clearly that they are made in china. I had the same problem and returned the same battery from Wireless Phone Accessories and Batteries4Less.AMAZON_- you should be screening these sellers and addressing these issues. There are a ton of posts under every single one of the Motorola Razr battery listing that say they got bad or counterfeit batteries.Theses companies make their money by selling junk, counting on the Amazon customer not to feel it is worth the hassle to return it. For every one I have to return I lose an hour of my time. My time is worth more than th $10 I get ripped off for. But I do it anyway b/c hopefully at some point AMAZON is going to take responsibility for the conduct of their market sellers. AMAZON's new logo is to become the most customer centric company on earth. Well AMAZON, you can start here: Bargain Cell -- which is one of the worst offenders, Wireless Phone Accessories and now the OEM Shop -- what a joke for a name for the last one since clearly they KNOW they are selling counterfeit batteries.I paid $30 for one from batteries4less hoping to get the real deal -- I got the exact same batter I got from the OEM shop -- the exact same counterfeit. So it has nothing to do with the price paid. Just dishonest online sellers.",Neutral

I purchased three of these batteries and each one would not last through one day in standby (not making calls) before it went dead.

"Summary: Stay away, this product sports a very poor design...Pro:+ very low price+ very small and lightweight+ relatively easy to use+ pair up well with all my BT phonesCon:- morse-code like feedback signal - they try to accomplish too many tasks with single beep/tone.  1 short beep, 2 short beeps, 3 short beeps, 1 long beep, 3 beeps up, 3 beeps down.  like another reviewer said,  you really have to read the manual or keep it nearyby to be able to understand what all the beeping means.- echos no matter what volume you set it, partly because this thing is very loud- insanely difficult to open the battery door.  I got so frustrated, I was about to throw this thing out of the window.  For a product that use regular batteries, the battery door is the most difficult to open.  Once opened, you need a pair of tweazers to pull the battery out.  The battery compartment is very deep and extremely snug.  This must be a sick joke by Motorola.  Forget about changing the battery on the go, you need to sit down and have a few tools and a lot of patience.  (for the record: this was my breaking point, i had to return this unit, because installing the battery for the first time was enough of a turn-off)- sound quality is mediocre at best",Neutral
Its cheap the wristlet is like a little thread and not sturdy at all. You have to clip your uncased phone into the plastic backing attached 5o the purse. Money part needs length to really pack some cash in. Id like a better cash compartment which is one thing I wanted in my purchase.  Id say purchase a cheaper product like this. Id the wristlet breaks and im positive it will your product is pointless.  Buyer be aware. Update. I stopped using this. The same day I got this my phone was kind of stuck in it and without thinking I was madly pulling at it. Needless to say my note 2 went flying and cracked the screen to pieces. Just be careful handling your phone since this privides no protection and can be tough to disengage from the phone.,Neutral
"This is a great case for the Note 2.  I had been undecided about whether to use a cover such as this or a belt holster as I've always used.  I wound up ordering both, this and a REIKO case.  They both work good separately, but not together.  If you try to use both, it is almost impossible to remove the Note 2 from the REIKO as it becomes stuck due to the tight fit.  I decided to use the BoxWave exclusively and have not been dissatisified with my decision.  I simply slide the Note 2 into my front pocket.  And no, the phone isn't too big for my pants pocket.The pros for this case is that it makes the Note 2 look stylish, and due to the rubbery feel, it makes the phone feel quite stable in my hand; however, the rubbery feel doesn't interfere with it going in and out of my pocket.  If I had to come up with a con for the BoxWave Tuxedo Suitup case, it would be that due to its glossiness, it shows fingerprints,  However, they wipe off easily.In summary, I would definitely order one of these cases again.",Neutral
"Adds too much bulk to my phone, hence I purchased a different case.  Also unlike the pictures on the site, the buttons on your phone will be covered.

I've bought several hard cases for my note2 and this one is my favorite. It's easy to put on and take off (once you figure it out).

"I always buy BoxWave cases for my phones, because they are well made, practical, comfortable and good looking. This time I am disappointed, the cuts for camera with flash, S-pen, speaker and microphones are too big and it looks ugly.

It works and has a low profile so that I can close the cigarette lighter door when it's not in use - two things I like.  My Android phone warns me to use the (Verizon) charger that came with the phone or charging will be very slow.

I cannot stand the A/C wall charger that came with the Fire. It is ridiculously short making it very difficult to find a place to charge it safely and I have purchased several of these cords since last Christmas and a majority work for a while and then break or don't work at all. Sometimes it is hit or miss and then sometimes a cord charges and then sometimes it acts up and refuses to charge. I have the same plug on my Samsung Stratosphere and I don't seem to have the same problem.With this cord the part that plugs into the Fire virtually fell apart. I don't care how much you pay for one of these type of cord, they should all work. When I started using it, this cord ""appeared"" on my visual inspection to be well made, but I guess looks are deceiving. The cord, of course, fell apart after the return date so I'm stuck.I really don't recommend this cord. I realize that it could be just a single defective one,but, of the three other reviews, only one person out of four of us recommended this cord. So just beware.",Neutral

"Want to basically eliminate your issues with holding this device in a secure way while maintaining the total coolness of it?This may be just what you were looking for. Seems to be actual leather unlike many similar cases that claim to be leather and are actually plastic. So if you wear skinny jeans and tend to keep the phone shoved in a pocket, this is not for you. But if you carry it elsewhere and are not concerned with combining your phone with some essential bits of your wallet, this is really really nice. If you tend to travel in a car and wind up carrying both the phone and your wallet into places to eat. This allows you to get three basic things out of the wallet and eliminate the need to carry two into the restaurant.It makes holding onto the phone less complicated by a factor of a googol. Particularly in landscape.The material (seems to be leather) is impregnated with a serious amount of oil so when you close the lid, it leaves a mark on the face of the phone. The simple solution to this is to get a paper index card, fold it at the red line on the top and shove the little folded bit in to the slot behind the cards. Not only do you then have the &34;old way&34; to fall back on if you need to actually write anything down )or have someone write something down for you(, but you add a perfect layer of weightless scratch proof protection to your ever so fragile Nexus 4 screen.For less than what you might pay for the 'official' bumper....no brainer.",Neutral
This Classic Book iPhone case is flimsy and the cover will not remain closed. Not good protection for an iPhone.,Neutral
"Let's start off with the fact that this is a well made case and fit my Nexus 4 flawlessly. The workmanship was good and after an initial breakin period that lessened the oil seepage and the smell I was very pleased with the feel. I used this for about two months before switching and had almost no wear or other issues. I tend to carry very small wallets and had hoped to use this product to combine the wallet and the phone into one convenient package.But still, it just didn't work out. It was awkward to hold while making phone calls because of the large ""spine"" on the case and I'm old school in that I actually talk on the phone. And the ""wallet"" portion wasn't quite up to snuff. By the time I put my driver's license in there (an exceptionally tight fit on the windowed part of the case and I was almost not able to remove it later) and a couple of credit cards it was actually too thick to keep in any pocket comfortably. The ""covers"" of the case are very thick while they protect the phone and contents, two of them are too much when combined with the thickness of my thin Nexus 4 and a couple of credit cards. I tried keeping it in a hammer pocket in my carpenter's jeans and in some cargo pants, but it was too high to fit well into those pockets.I really like the concept of this thing, but it just didn't do what I hoped it would.",Neutral
"I've previously owned a multitude of headsets, but let me tell you I was missing out until I bought a Jabra.I always thought the ""in the ear"" bud and bulky-looking design would be uncomfortable, but it was not.  Frankly it is the the most comfortable headset I have ever worn, and I've worn dozens.  I truly forget it is on my head.As for sound quality, everything I hear is clear, with ample volume available.  People I speak to report equally clear sound without much, if any background noise.Battery life is great and range is sufficient for me to put my smartphone on the cradle and walk around the house or the office without any signal loss or crackling.Something else I liked was the belt clip.  So many headsets overlook the fact that you have nowhere to put your earpiece when you're not using it.  The belt clip is small, just big enough to actually hold the headset, and tucks in right behind the clip for my phone.If you're not a clip-loving person, the whole headset has an almost flat profile so it fits nicely in a pocket.  Other headsets, especially those with flip-out mics feel awfully bulbous in a pocket.One last little ""Gee Whiz"" feature- the vibro-alert.  Since I want my phone on the charge/sync cradle whenever possible, this feature really excites me.  Instead of being required to actually wear the headset at all times to avoid missing a call when the phone is in the other room, this headset has a vibrate feature to notify me of an incoming call.  I call this a ""gee whiz"" feature because I never knew I needed it until I had it!In summary, there are an awful lot of headsets out there.  All of the designs and features can be confusing, but you can rest assured knowing that this headset has everything you need (and some things you may not!) and does so at a very reasonable price.",Neutral
"Perhaps I just got a bad one, but this thing won't consistently work 4 feet away from the phone, let alone the 30 they claim. It's a nice design, and if it worked I'd be very happy with it.UPDATE: I just got a new BT250v after Amazon was kind enough to exchange my unit sight unseen (they even shipped out the new unit before I'd shipped back the bad one). Unfortunately, while the new unit works somewhat better, it still doesn't work as well as it should. For example, there is noticeable popping (interference) if i put my phone in my pocket, even on the same side as the headset. I've tried many combinations of phone and headset, and the only time I have problem is with this headset, so I'm quite sure it's not an issue with my phone, or with bluetooth in general. (In fact, I've had far better luck with other Jabra BT products.) So, the design is beautiful and the product is great when it works, but I've found that it fails when I really need it.FINAL UPDATE: I chucked it. Don't believe the breathless reviews about this. If you use this in everyday life--i.e. with the phone more than a few feet from your head--people on the other end will hear static. I got so sick of people asking me ""what's that clicking sound?"" that I threw the stupid thing away. I'm amazed people love this so much. They must be so floored by the idea of wireless technology they haven't actually tried using it for a real conversation, or they haven't actually tried to call another person. With two bad experiences with this company, that was the last Jabra product I'll ever buy.",Neutral
"1st month, very good. 2nd month, dropping calls and no one can seem to hear me.  It was like I was not on a wireless bluetooth.

Not worth it.",Neutral
"I bought this headset at the same time as my Verizon Palm Treo 650.  Pairing was a snap, and it supported the hands free profile.  The call quality was great on both ends (however wind or car A/C caused people on the other end to have lower quality).  I only charged it twice - day one and one week later.  I used it for about a total of one to two hours a day on my commute.There was just one drawback, and it was a deal-breaker for me.  I wear glasses, and the bulk of the headset behind the ear made it very uncomfortable.  I returned the headset today after I had to end my call on the way home after 20 minutes.  If you don't wear glasses, this is an ideal bluetooth headset for the Treo 650.",Neutral
"BT250 and this newer BT250v are pure junk.  The sound quality on these two units are horrid, there are no other ways to describe it.  My friends and coworkers can identify these units remotely and asked that I do not speak to them using the BT250 or BT250v.  The microphone is sooooo sensitive and un-tuned, it is particularly unusable in cars or while walking.  The road noise or wind noise will over saturate your voice.  Even under ideal quiet surrounding, normal speech will come out muddy and weak.  The battery life also shortens significantly during the  1 year warranty with moderate use.  The button on this unit doesn't help with usability.  With the earhook design, one would push the button in the direction perpendicular into the ear to activate the button, a task easily done with one finger and no pain.  However, this unit uses the behind the ear design, where you would have to use two fingers with a motion to pinch your earlobe to activate the button, it's truly an unpleasant experience.  In addition, the vibrate alert feature is just stupid and useless.  In most cases, one would be wearing this unit, so the audible ringing can be heard--why would you need it to vibrate???I truly advise against buying this unit.",Neutral
"I did my research years ago when I purchased this off Amazon. It's been the best headset for all these years. It followed me through 2.5mm cell phones to 3.5mm cell phones with an adapter. Sadly, the other parties can no longer hear me with it. I even tried a new 2.5 to 3.5mm adapter with no luck. I'm looking for a new headset and there's NOTHING like this one. Shure had it right and I wish they still made it. Not everyone likes bluetooth where it's hard to hear and be heard. I can't believe there's nothing like this on the market anymore. Jabra all has bad reviews and I tried a Plantronics one and returned it. I'm mourning the loss of this headset and wish it'd magically work again.",Neutral

"This is the only bluetooth headset I've tried. Using with a motorola e815 with verizon.Calling is good with the voice-dialing with the e815. Good range for the signal. Some areas you have an increased static interference, but it's pretty minimal. Occational pop-sounds, not crackling or static for the most part. I guess you could say not a lot of bass and volume can't be made ""loud"" but is certainly loud enough for regular calls. Traffic/other loud background noise will wash out calls...but that's no different than wired headsets (or natice cell useage either).I have about 50-50 usage of the headset wearing it and leaving it closed in the pocket. I charge it every night, never had a low-battery problem in a day. Talk 2-4hrs a day on average. If in the pocket I can get it out, unflipped and talking on the phone before the call cancels (it's close though). Thought the flip close was wierd at first, but probably the best interface, wouldn't want to have to mess with a button to wakeup/connect. Connect time to cell is about 1-2 seconds after opening.Comfort is the worst thing about this headset. Leaving it on for 1-2hrs your ear will be SORE. Half of the headset is very stiff plastic with heavy wire inside, other half is flimsy plastic (looks like it would be soft on the ear but doesn't seem that way). Doesn't seem to sit nicely in the ear and you can't adjust  up/down/back/forward. I can see why that is, because the ear part is spring-loaded to keep headset tight against the ear but it's not good.Worth the money, hope a newer version improves the comfort level.",Neutral
"As a long-time Motorola bluetooth headset user, I can tell you from painful experience that there are fundamental flaws in the HS850.  In fact, I went through FOUR HS850 headsets (under warranty) before Motorola decided to upgrade me to the H700 (despite the lower model number, the H700 is a newer model).The HS850 and H700 have the same characteristics:- Over-the-ear swing arm earpiece that can be used on left or right ear- Flip-open boom microphone that turns the headset on/off- Easy volume controls- Toggle switch to connect/disconnect calls (or put them on hold/mute)- Easy pairing- Good published battery life- Standard Motorola power connectorsWhat's the difference?  Well, ""good published"" battery life is the distinction.  All four of the HS850 headsets worked for a few weeks or months, but then would not hold a charge.  Battery life went down to MINUTES.Dealing with Motorola support was a nightmare.  Apparently, their support center for these products was in Argentina, and they could only do what was in their script to help me.  After the fourth failure, I insisted on getting a support contact at their corporate HQ in Illinois.  That support contact was a dream.  After reviewing my case, he gave me the H700 as a replacement.  I had that headset for 1.5 years, and it had kept its battery life and functionality.  Of course, I lost it and had to buy a replacement...and given all the choices, I got another H700.Do NOT fall for the lower price of the HS850.  I've seen prices as low as $15 for this model.  I think you'll be frustrated and disappointed in the end.",Neutral
"As an early adopter of mobile technology, I am always seeking new wireless gadgets to improve my productivity.  So, after a friend reported having good success with the HS850, I acquired one on eBay.  Unfortunately, the sound quality is below expectations and I continue to use my wired headset.My cell phone goes with me everywhere, especially when I drive.  Hence, I have been using wired headset for the past ten years.  The tangling of the headset wire with itself and my mp3 headphones gets rather annoying.  So, I was looking forward to time when the reviews of Bluetooth headsets became positive in the press.When I purchased this model, the information I saw was rather positive, especially about the form factor.  The model is both light and easy to operate.  It intelligently turns on when flipping open the boom.  However, the ring which goes around your ear is just is barely strong enough to keep the headset on.  While it hasn't fallen off, it constantly feels like it might whenever my head is moving.My big complaint with the HS850 is the sound quality. Not only is there a slight hiss, but there is also a slightly noticeable electronic digitization.  I would think by 2006 this problem would be corrected.  It sounds very much like the first generation of digital cell phones.  Because of this, I would recommend considering other models.ProsSmallLightweightConsMediocre sound qualityDoesn't hold tightly enough.",Neutral

"I bought this headset to replace my HS820.  I previously used both the Motorola HS850 and the HS820 and had the same two problems with each.- Insecure attachment to my ear.- Insuffcient volumeWhenever I moved, the motorola headsets wiggled and made me feel as if they were about to fall off. They never did but it was still annoying.The volume problem was in part related to this. The contact with my ear wasn't very firm and the ambient noise that the headsets let in coupled with a relatively low volume meant that I had to press the headset to my ear to hear clearly.I gave it 2 stars rather than one because of the GREAT battery life.I finally bought a Plantronics 510 and have been very satisfied.",Neutral
"I bought this earpiece a month ago to go with my brand new Nextel i870.  It worked sorta ok but was a bit finiky when used with my phone in my belt holder.  I didnt wear it all the time, just when I was commuting to and from work.  I kept it in my pocket so it would be on standby, in contact with my phone.  Most times, it would connect quickly and function well.  Ocassionally, it would seem to connect, but when I attempted an outgoing call, it would disconnect.I also had trouble hearing the unit while driving.  As I am approaching my mid 50's, my hearing is not as acute as in past years, and the internal noise from the pickup truck (windows up, and AC running) makes hearing the other party on the earpiece difficult.My main problem with this unit is the recharge plug.  I have 3 Nextel/Motorola phones that use this type of plug and have not had any trouble with it.  The plug end has a release button to depress when unplugging.  The catch on my HS850 charger plug was more difficult to release and required much more pressure to release than my other 2 Motorola charger plugs of the same type.  This contributed to undue stress on the socket and eventually the socket pulled loose.  I probably charged it 6-7 times over the month I had it.I intend to replace my HS850 with some other type that has an earpiece that fits in my ear, providing some sound isolation from environmental noises, rather than the lay on this ear type.Be careful unplugging this unit from its charging plug.",Neutral
"I like the look of this headset, and I really like the fact that flipping the boom turns it on and off instantly.However, the Motorola HS850 performs much worse than my much older Logitech Mobile Traveller Bluetooth Headset.  Everyone I call indicates that I sound muffled, and callers typically ask me to discontinue the use of the headset.  Also, the earpiece speaker is not that loud, so it is rather hard for me to hear callers when there is background noise (e.g., in the car).I just purchased this a couple of weeks ago.  I am giving it to a friend and ordering a different one (Plantronics Voyager 510?).",Neutral
"IMHO this is slightly better than the Moto H700.  It's larger, and a bit heavier.  The boom is larger.  But if that's not an issue, then both are equal IMHO.  Both have the cheek problem!Now for the problem where people cannot hear you, or you sound muffled or away from the phone.  Wearing your bluetooth, look in the mirror and see how the boom touches your cheek or if you have a beard it'll touch that.  Note there is a very small hole on the inside of the boom that gets the sound.  Now anything that touches that will impede your voice....it's like putting a towel over a regular phone and talking to someone. Not you do not need puffy cheeks for this problem to happen.  Unless you have a very narrow face, chances are this will happen to you and you'll blame it on the bluetooth!TO fix this, get either Neoprene tubing or that sticky foam on one end (mole skin) and cut a small piece and put on the hinge near the boom then a smaller piece (if needed) on top of the other.  This will make a space between your cheek and the boom so people can hear you! With this fix, you will still be able to close your boom.",Neutral

It is very easy to put on and off. There are 2 minor issues with this:a) You need to take extra care when you plug on the charger, to make sure the phone charges - the leather cover comes in the way of the charger - after a few accidental ""battery dying out"", I learned to connect it properly to get a full charge.b) The elastic band/top cover comes in the way of the camera - so for taking pictures, I remove the top sleeve.c) Inspite of all the positive feedback, I still feel it makes the phone bulky, but the belt clip is very tough, and I don't mind the extra bulk to act like a cowboy.",Neutral

It seems to have worse reception than my previous phones (all Nokia bar type) in the same coverage areas.  The biggest issue is definitely the battery.  I am NOT a heavy cell phone user so I like to just leave the phone in my car or gym bag and not worry about it for a couple days.  This phone will drain in 8 hours to 36 hours - with MINIMAL USAGE.  I don't know why it drains so quickly or with what seems to be random speeds, but it is extremely frustrating.

"I've been using this phone for about three weeks on the T-Mobile system within CT and while travelling. It has been an easy to operate phone. There are a few minor flaws that I've found which you may want to consider prior to making a purchase decision.PROS-Solid reception - seems to hold calls pretty well - have not experienced unexpected call drops.-As near as I can tell people are hearing my calls clearly-Easy to text message with predictive entry - very clear interface and helpful completion of words-While on T-Mobile you can be browsing the web and also receive an incoming voice call (though you cannot continue to browse - the key is that it doesn't send people to your Voicemail). I believe this is a function of the GSM technology that T-Mobile and Cingular operate under.CONS-Earpiece volume is low - you'll have difficulty using this in noisy environments.-Not EDGE (high speed Internet) capable-If there is a way to have multiple contact info (home, business, cell, email) for one address book entry - I haven't found it. Instead I have awkwardly had to setup multiple address entries (how 1980's).-The phone offers a Bluetooth connection - and there should be a standard keypress to turn the BT on and off. Instead you have to create a shortcut or re-map one of the ""smart"" keys to do the task.-It should be easier to change ring styles - most phones allow you to change the style to vibrate right from the volume buttons or a key press - the V330 supports this (kinda) but you have to use the up/down volume and then a smart key to select. The extra steps are tedious when you are trying to go into a store or movie theater and want to mute the phone.SUMMARYI'd purchase this phone again for T-Mobile. I considered other phones before making this purchase and the overall features (including the ability to use Bluetooth)are what attracted me to the V330.The requirement to list multiple names in the phone book is really odd and it might be that I just haven't found the ""secret"". The phone doesn't come with any type of detailed user manual so you have to go online and look at a PDF to get the information. So far I have not uncovered any secret. If I had a large phone book that I wanted to use, then I'd probably have passed on this phone (and any other Motorola using a similar scheme).If you are frequently in noisy environments, this probably is not the phone for you either. The earpiece is just too low. I'm constantly trying to raise the volume when talking to someone out in a crowded place that has noise.For a good middle-of-the road phone with solid reception, I don't think you can go too wrong with the V330.",Neutral

"I have tested many bluetooth headsets. This one sets the bar pretty high.  The battery life is wonderful usually outlasting a phone charge by a factor of two. It is generally compatible with just about all the regular phones.  If you have a Palm OS phone, pick a different headset as this MAY work, but has some issues that I find are difficult to live with.The good: This is a very durable headset (mine went through the washer and dryer and still works after it dried out for a few days).  The multiple options for ear pieces, flexibility of the design (switching ears without carrying extra accessories), compatibility with lots of phones, antenna design solving cross body communications for some phones, charging options with USB and power (you can wear it while charging comfortably), and battery life all are great. It connects to 2 devices at a time though you can obviously only answer one of them at a time.The Bad: (all minor) The wind smart does not work that great.  I have yet to find a bluetooth headset that can handle direct wind noise and this is no exception. It does better than most but remote parties still complain. Every headset I have tested fails here. This is difficult to distinguish between mute on the headset and power off. I tuned it off a few times on accident when trying to mute.  Oops. The mute also does not alert you frequently enough that it is on, but you can still mute from the phone separately without issues.  Pairing is simple, but not just a one button option.I would suggest this headset to users looking for a good headset for most devices. Consider other options with Palm OS phones.",Neutral

Is much clunkier than my last Plantronics (330).

"The technology couldn't be better. Bluetooth conecteivity is simple to establish. The overall physical design is excellent. Though it looks heavy, the unit is a featherweight and fits nicely around the ear. Long-term wearing is comfortable. Audio fidelity is excellent.Where the unit fails badly, though, is the controls. They do not provide enough tactile input. You cannot be certain of where the volume control is or which end of the rocker switch increases or decreases the volume. Since the volume defaults to moderately low setting, this means you are likely to miss the first words of whatever your caller is saying which in turn means a lot of asking ""what did you say?"".The Call Control button handles at least four different functions. On a phone equipped to handle all four functions, it is easy to mistakenly select a function. For example, on my phone, if I hold the Call Control button a fraction too long, the call is not answered, but the prompt to enter a Voice Speed Dial entry is actuated. No fun when you are trying to answer a call.Plantronics provides three earpiece inserts and it's unlikely that one of them won't provide a comfortable, snug fit.Overall, excellent technology marred by poor ergonomics.Jerry",Neutral
This is my second headset replacing the Motorola one that came with my cell phone.  People I call tell me that the sound is very clear on their end and cannot tell that I am using the headset - sounds just like I am talking into the phone.  That was not the case with the first one. I travel a lot and wear the headset for long periods.  My ear does not get tired or sore from having it on.  The headset seems well balanced and never seems like it is going to fall off regardless of what I am doing.  I also like that it folds flat for easy carrying in my shirt pocket.,Neutral
"I bought this to pair with a Sony Ericsson Walkman phone, and have been disappointed.1) Sound and voice quality are fine, but this thing is way too sensitive to wind.  I can't use it outside if there is any wind current, and even the air currents from my car's AC or heat are too much for it.2) Most disappointingly, the microphone boom cracked in half after about 60 days.  I am working with Plantronics' warranty department, but they need a ""date code,"" which is unreadable without a magnifying glass.  I will update once I have some resolution.3) This device only works for the Ericsson's phone functions, not music, because the Walkman music functions use the ""A2DP"" Bluetooth protocol, and the 510 is not A2DP compatible.

This is my third/fourth Plantronics headset.This one  bought for dual pairing with my LT and my cell phone.(iPhone).It works fine with both.I am subtracting marks for the followinga) Changing charger designs. Third headset, none of the chargers are interchangeable, so I always get the AC charger, but have to buy the car chargerb) For iPhone, this works only for the phone. Music will not work. Now I am looking instead at the Plantronics 855 Stereo Headset - do handle both = phone/music and still do dual pairing with LT",Neutral
"I've had this for 2 years now and am pleased with quality, durability, and reliability. It is surprisingly comfortable considering the girth of the piece that goes over and behind the ear. My past headsets with earloops were horribly painful after a very short time, this one I can wear for hours, barely noticing it. It came with 3 different earpieces - one small, one large, and one teardrop shaped - so fit was not a problem. Sound quality is good enough that people frequently comment on how clear I sound and I am nearly always using it in the car. Wind cancellation really is insufficient, but this has not been a major issue for me...I just use it with the windows up or mostly up. I frequently leave this thing on overnight and still use it for a couple of days afterwards with no loss of power. Talk time is at least the 6 hours claimed and stand-by time can be measured in days.  Some people are troubled by the proprietary power cord, but it's a small matter as I have a household-type plug in my car and charge it while driving if need be, though it cannot be charged and used simultaneously.  I came here to see if I wanted to upgrade to another Plantronics model and pass this headset on to my daughter, but I think I'm going to keep it and buy her the same model.UPDATE:Still a 5 star item and I am on my second one.  After 2.5 years the first one broke at the top of the earloop.  I taped it with sports tape and kept using it without any problems, but I figured it was only a matter of time before it didn't work anymore so I replaced it. Others have said that the new 510s are junk, but I've been using mine for about 5 months now and it's exactly as great as the original.  The broken one is still working, too.",Neutral
"I've went through 3 of these bluetooth headsets in 5 years. When I got my first one it was extremely cheaper than offered now. The only reason I had to get my second one was because my dog chewed it up, then I backed over my second one with my car in the driveway, so I bought the third. Thinking I was still getthing the exact same quality as before I wanted to stick with what I knew. I connected it to multiple bt compatible devices with ease... PS3, iPod Touch, iPhone, Blackberry, etc. All three times I purchased this product it ran no more than $30, but since they've redesigned it the quality has gone down & the price has increased to what you see now. I especially liked the fact that it had three different ear buds to accustom its users, but the part that went around the ear became annoying at times. Pending on what you're doing cut I'd be cleanin & sweating & it wouldn't hold firm. Same thing if I walked outside (Note that I'm in Tx,so it's very humid) the ear piece would come out. Btw, my third one is getting trashed because people can no longer hear me clearly and I only had this one for about 4 months. If you know better than this product stick with it because my 3 star rating is for the 4 years I had the previous version & not this new, redesigned, $126 version. You could absolutely do better elsewhere.Oh yea, after a while of frequent use, it began to split. I may try to show you guys a picture because with Platonics this design is known to do that. Lesson learned...",Neutral
It wouldn't work if the phone and the Bluetooth were more than ten feet apart.  The pairing was not as bad but many times it would disconnect one line or the other,Neutral
"The Plantronics Voyager 510 has been an absolute work horse for me for the past nearly 2 years.  When I say workhorse I mean it.  I put over 5 hours of talk time on this device 5 days a week for well over a year.  I used it in a weekly 4 hour commute, during the day in the office, at night to talk to my family from the hotel and a number of other usages.  I know this device and using it is as familiar as turning on my blinker in the car.The Good:1. Great noise filtering.  The microphone does a great job of filtering out ambient noise including wind.2. The battery is excellent and lasts for days on standby and for at least 6 hours talking.3. Multipoint Technology.  This technology rocks.  I have both my work (Blackberry) and personal cell phone synched with this device at the same time and can call or answer either without pairing hassles.4. Pairs with a device that it has been setup with by simply pressing the primary button.5. Volume buttons on earpiece.6. Comes with multiple earpieces for comfort.7. Stable in the ear.  It doesn't feel as if it will fall out.8. Durable.  I used this hard for a few years and it has only now started to fall apart.  Still works though.9. Shares common power supply with many other Plantronics devices for ease of power sharing.10. Larger then competitors but very light.The Not so Good:1. It is bigger then most other devices.2. The earpieces are prone to fall out and don't stay secured after about 6 months.As you can see I really don't have much bad to say about this device.  I am only now replacing it after 2 years of use and that is because the earpiece fell out and I can't find the pack that came with it.  It still works!  I replaced this unit with the Plantronics Discovery 925 and I might like that even better.  For the money though you cannot beat the Voyager 510 in my opinion.  5 stars!",Neutral
"This is my first Bluetooth headset.  I purchased it because it seemed to get the most positive reviews out of all that I looked at.  It has performed very well.  People say they can here me as well if not better than when I use the phone itself.  I would recommend it.The one problem I sometimes have, in using it with my Motorola e815, is that it will sometimes become unpaired, randomly.  I believe it's specific to this phone as reported by others.  It seems to happen about a minute after 1 out of 20 calls.  I found sometimes it will pair to the phone again by quickly pressing the side button twice (which then causes the phone to redial, so you then need to end the call).  The other way is to turn the phone off and back on again.  The latest thing I tried is turning off the phone's powersave feature.  I've heard from others that that feature could be causing the problem, but we will see.  I probably should get a new phone anyway since mine is 2 1/2 years old.  Then the unpairing problem will likely disappear.",Neutral
"Unfortunately, I purchased mine when it was $100 and have never been able to use it.  I didn't return it right away because I thought I would be able to read the directions that came with it and figure out how to unmute it, but have never been able to.  I can hear the other people, but they can't hear me.  No matter what I do, it won't unmute.  The buttons on it are very small and difficult to use when it's in your ear.  I finally got a different bluetooth that works just fine.",Neutral
"For me the sound quality is by far the most important factor when I compare headsets. Everything else is secondary. I drive a very noisy construction van so background noise is a serious problem. I have compared 8 different headsets and the Plantronics Voyager 510 is the only one that allows a clear conversation in this environment. I have used it daily for over 2 years and often for 6+ hours straight until the battery is dead. In a loud, dirty, construction environment, often lying on the ground, it's the only thing I've found that works. With the other models, either I, the caller, or both of us couldn't understand a word being said. For those of you that don't have background noise issues, I can add that even in quiet settings this unit has better sound quality than all the others that I tested. The way that I do my tests is to pair 2 headsets, put one in each ear and then switch between them while on the same call. This way I and the caller can compare the sound quality at almost the exact same time. The 2 cons I can mention are that the on/off button is too small and hard to push, and that when the battery is almost dead the buttons stop working (even though the sound continues fine) so you have to hang up using the phone instead of the headset. To be fair though, the ""almost dead battery"" symptoms happen in many of the other ones I've tested also. I don't care, sound is everything.",Neutral
"I've had other bluetooth head sets - I found them uncomfortable to wear and I was always asking people to repeat themselves.  This headset fits nicely on my ear - sometimes I forget it's even on!  And for the very first time EVER I had to turn the volume down!  I only gave it four stars because the volume controls are difficult to get to, but that's a small price to pay for the clarity you get.",Neutral
"I previously used both the Motorola HS850 and the HS820 and had the same two problems with each.  Insuffcient volume and insecure attachment to my ear.  Whenever I moved, the motorola headsets wiggled and made me feel as if they were about to fall off.  They never did but it was still annoying.  The volume problem was in part related to this.  The contact with my ear wasn't very firm and the ambient noise that the headsets let in coupled with a relatively low volume meant that I had to press the headset to my ear to hear clearly.I have been satisfied with my Plantronics 510.  The choice of 3 interchangable ear cushions, great volume, crisp output and decent range make it unbeatable.  The battery life is somewhat less that the motorola headsets, but I purchased an extra charger for home.  The power button is small, but using it is  a minor problem that resolves with a little practice.  The sound is crisp and clear.  The range is as good or better than the motorola sets.",Neutral
"I bought mine from Amazon cuz this was just about the lowest price I could find. Before I actually bought it I did some serious testing and reading about other headsets. I've tried Jabra 250, Jabra 500, Motorola HS850 and they all had one major problem - quite static-y. Actually the HS850 was a little better in this area than the Jabra headsets. I've had Jabra 250 for almost two years - static-y big time. If I put the phone in my left pant pocket and the headset on the right ear theres' noise all the time - this is not acceptable for me. The HS850, unlike the Jabra, has poor design. Any time I turn my head sharply this thing is flabbing on my ear as if it's going to fly out at any moment. This is why I wanted something better, not the same.I went on Amazon and read reviews on all kinds of headsets and my attention stopped on the Plantronics Voyager 510 from some company I'd never heard of. The the reviews were good. Even though my BestBuy store didn't carry it I decided to make the investment, buy it online and test it in the hopes to keep it.I received my headset, hooked it up to my phone - that was easy, no problem here.Then as soon as I started using it I noticed that there was no static, almost no static. I could keep my phone anywhere around me and there would be no static - a major advantage to the previous headsets.Then I noticed how easy it is to answer phone calls with it. the answer button is large enough, right against the ear, so I just had to press it against the ear using one finger. How cool is that?! The HS850 design was like that too but the Jabra 250 needed two fingers to answer one to support the headset and the other to press the answer button - I noticed with the new Jabra 500 that wasn't an issue anymore.The Plantronics is light, easy to put on, not flabby  - wraps around your ear pretty good.There's only a few things I didn't like about it and I hope the manufacturer is listening now:1. Picks up surrounding noise. If I am out people can hardly hear what I'm saying - even if there's hardly any wind. It's so bad that I've given up on using it outside.2. The ear bud needs to be tinier. I loved the small jelly-type of earpiece that Jabra had - you could hardly feel it in your ear.3. The power button is too tiny and hard to push. Not that this is a big deal because I hardly ever need to shut down my headset but it would be nice to have one that's larger still one that's not easy to hit by accident.I didn't give this review five stars because the headset needs to do a better job at fending off surrounding noise.Other than that, I highly recommend this headset. I have yet to see a headset that's as good as this one!",Neutral
"For a few years I have been with verizon .My last phone was the Motorola e815 .Recently I retired and didn't need all the mins I got on the $39 plan(with taxes came to $44)  pro: I bought the razr v3 on ebay and transfered over to T-Mobile prepaid.the phone works just great and through my Parrot 3200ls handsfree sounds just great.con:When I went to program speed dialing .Boy was I disappointed .First it would only allow 20 voice tags .Then I had to record each individual tag for voice recognition My e815 allowed me to use unlimited voicetags and I didn't have to record my voice on each number,anyones voice would work using any name in my phone book .The Razr is supposed to be an improvement ,which it's not .The Motorola e815 was the best phone I ever owned ,and now Motorola screwed it up .Whats the point of using bluetooth handsfree dialing when you have to scroll down to a name to dial,taking your hands off the wheel  .Wake up Motorola ,Thats stupid .",Neutral

"These are some decent headphones, but if you use them they WILL break.  It's only a matter of time.  I did some research and found the following tips to prevent/fix the breaking:Solution 1:Put the band portion of the headphones in boiling water for a while and slowly spread them open. Once you have them opened up some take them out of the water and let them cool while holding them in the spread position. This reduces the tension of the headphones against your ears and reduces the stress put on the headphone band. This results in two advantages, less pressure on your ears resulting in better comfort and no cracking of the band.If you stretch them to far they will fit too loose and will lose some of there bass effect. But all you have to do is reheat them and close them up a little until you get the fit you want.Solution 2:Even if your headband has broken in two this will still work. It will only take a little patience and $5.00 of materials from a local hobby shop.Materials:- 3/4 inch or 1 inch nylon tape (all hobby stores that have RC Plane materials have this)- CA (cyanoacrylate) the stuff that superglue is made of but I recommend getting some real CA at any hobbystore. Get the ""thin"" stuff.- Saran Wrap. yes the sandwich stuff...- ScissorsSide note: I call the nylon tape ""tape"", but it is really just a ribbon of nylon. There is no sticky stuff on the ""tape""1) First if your headset has snapped completely in two use a little CA to mend it as best as you can. It doesnt need to be perfect but just mended enough that it is technically one piece again and headphones are seperated to where you want them to be.2) Next cut off a 6 inch piece of the nylon tape and using a VERY small amount of CA, tack the top edge of the tape to the BACK of the band where the crack has occured (which should be exactly in the middle of the band in most cases). Use just enough so it sticks as you don't want too much CA getting into the ribbon. It should be hanging down now in the back like a tail. Note: Use the saran wrap to help hold the tape in place as you are tacking it in place as you DO NOT want this stuff to get on your fingers...3) Once the CA has dried enough and the tape is stuck, wrap the tape under and around the band one time until the tape is hanging down again in the back. Pull the tape VERY tight and use a little bit of CA at the top to keep it in place.4) Wrap around one more time and tack it again one more time making sure to always keep the tape tight when you tack it. You should have wrapped the tape around twice at this point. If your set was broken completely in two you may want to wrap one or two more times and at a slight angle to cover a little more area. When done, use some scissors to cut off the excess tape at a point so the cut end of the tape is at the back.5) Now you can saturate the whole band of tape with CA. Use the saran wrap to press down the cut end of the tape as you glue and it will end up perfectly flat. This is an incredibly strong fiberglass patch similar to carbon fiber. The patch will have a very small profile (not that thick) and be similar in color to scotch tape, however it could easily be painted to match the color of the headband if desired.There you have it. This is a permanent and SOLID fix and only takes about 5 minutes. I'm wearing mine right now after i just fixed them. Also you can do this (and I strongly suggest you do) to a set that has not cracked yet, because they WILL NOT CRACK if you do. Just do it exactly in the middle of the band.",Neutral
"I have both grey and black version nowthe sound is good, but it's kinda too tight like the grey oneI applied the reinforcement (cut a strip from plastic card, use Krazy glue to stick the plastic strip on the middle of headband, and use nylon packing tape to wrap), this'll affect the looking, but durability is more importantI repaired 4 of them for same cracking/breaking from other users, and used same method, and brought all of them back to servicethe sound of the headphones is good (pretty balanced on all frequency), I connect it directly to my pda (Dell X51v and T-Mobile MDA) and laptop without supplied audio adaptor, but I found the RF of the headphones is kinda weak, that I only get half of the range compared with moto HT820 and plantronics 590a (pairing passcode: 0000, bt a2dp support required)the audio adaptor is used with logiteches ONLY, will not work with other brands (even the passcode is 0000)if you know how to apply reinforcement to prevent headband breaking, the price is a steal now1st edit: this headphones DOES NOT support AVRCP (play/pause, prev, next), if you plan to use it on your laptop without audio adaptor, get the one for ipod (grey) instead",Neutral

"I just recieved my Treo 650 four days ago and am happy so far.  I bought it just to be an organizer, phone, mp3 player--in that order--so I can't speak to other features such as web access (currently an expensive $45 from Verizon).Two pieces of advice:1. Budget several hours to set up.  It's nearly like buying a new computer.  I had to transfer my calendar and contacts from my old Cli&eacute; and found that some of my old Palm applications caused the Treo to restart (I promptly deleted them). Generally it was just tedious software stuff, including a tricky firmware update from the Palm website, but don't expect to be ready out the door.2. Before you buy, budget for accessories.  After purchasing the following: case ($20), SD card reader ($10; for the easiest transfer of files to the SD card), 2GB SD card ($150), 2.5MM-compatible headphones ($17), 2.5MM>3.5MM headphone adapter ($10), extra sync cable ($13), mp3 player application ($15; the RealPlayer is clunky and doesn't have a graphic equalizer), I have nearly spent as much as the device itself!

Unfortunately, her Motorola Razr is such a dinosaur, I'd have to special order it from the actual manufacturer.Here's the surprise part......I just moved and finally found my Kindle. It's the Kindle touch, nothing special (not the fire or paperwhite). It's simply a black and white touch screen. Unfortunately, I couldn't find the charger, no matter where I looked!

"The Hype says:""Getting on the Internet is easy with the RAZR V3 as it supports Cingular's GSM-based Wireless Internet Express service. When used with a Cingular data plan and the phone's Bluetooth or USB data capability, the phone can be used as a wireless modem for laptops and PDAs.""I say:CACA! If you plan on connecting to the internet using this phone and bluetooth you had better get a mongo battery for your laptop because it's the slowest, laggiest, painfully irritating, useless piece of doggy doo that I have ever had the displeasure of using!

"The Motorola RAZR V3 is worst cell phone I have ever had.  The only nice feature is the camera and there are a lot of other cell phones with better features that have cameras too.  Also beware of the so-called rebate.  If you don't mind jumping through 50 million hoops to get it, well go for it but if your time is money, run from this rebate and this phone.  5 co-workers in my office thought we would take advantage of this offer and what we thought would be a cool, hip cell phone.  How wrong we all were.  Cingular is fine.  They have their issues like all the cell companies now for customer service but it is the phone itself & the rebate program that was an issue for ALL 6 of us.  3 people had problems with the buttons on the phone and had to send them back before they even got their rebates.  The acutual rebate thats up to 4 months to receive and that is only if you have correctly jumped through all of the hoops.  One mistake and you are screwed out of the $150 rebate.Another problem with the phone and it's limited features is that other than the initial tone that you have a message there is no way to know that you have a message waiting unless you pick up the phone and look.  All my older model cell phones featured a tone and/or a light on the outside of the phone to let you know that you had a message.I have never written a review before on Amazon or otherwise, but I feel that people should be aware that the cool, hip advertising of the RAZR is not what it is cracked up to be.",Neutral

Not only that the thing fell apart as I was taking it out of the box. I will be returning this garbage and getting my $5.00 back. Last time I ever purchase a Scosche product!",Neutral
"This thing is tiny & lightweight and works really well in a vehicle where you don't want long cables hanging around (especially if you drive a manual shift car).That being said, I have had two of these. I used them daily, and they each lasted about 4-6 months, and then they stopped working. The cables are very thin and I think they just wear out after a while. For the price & convenience, it's not a bad trade-off. I would have given it 3.5 stars if I'd had the option.I decided against ordering a third and opted for something non-retractable but hopefully more sturdy.",Neutral
"I bought this cable to connect my MP3 to the car radio. I like the rotating design that I can adjust the wire in long or short distance, once I pull the cable, it will rotate back automatically.",Neutral
"I am going to start by saying I have had a lot of trouble with aux cables for my iPod, I use them every day in my car. I prefer the short, thicker, straight cables, but after a few months, something happens with the wires inside, and sound starts to come out of one speaker only. For a while, I thought something was wrong with my iPod. I got a new one, same problem. Then I thought something was wrong with my car. Had it looked at, no problems. So, I figured it was the cables. After going through a few more (I've been through about 7, including the expensive Monster cable), I tried this cable as a last resort. It worked the best! I had my first one for over a year with no sound issues. A friend of mine didn't see the cable and sat on it. When she got up, it retracted very quickly and hit my stereo. It broke off a small piece of my aux input. So, if you have passengers, beware, this thing can become a slingshot! The retracting piece eventually  broke, so I decided to get a new one. The new one worked fine, but after a short time, the retracing piece started working off and on. I have decided to just deal with it. I'd rather have a broken retracing piece than a cable to only plays through one speaker.",Neutral
"I have used this cable on and off for about a year and a half -- but there were at least six months in the middle there where I had misplaced it and didn't use it at all. It recently went bad -- lost one of the stereo channels. It now connects one channel only.The problem is in the contacts. If I bend the cable near one of the ends I can get the other channel to come in intermittently. Note that I didn't ever fiddle with the ends during normal use. I have only tried the bending game to get the lost channel to come in.If you think the price is worth about 1 year of use, this is the cable you want to get. It certainly is convenient and I like the retractable feature a lot. Just wish it would have lasted longer.",Neutral
It lasted me 2 days then it didnt charge I thought it was my battery but no it was the charger,Neutral
"For the price you can't go wrong here. Works perfectly for my PSP 3K. I have only used it a few times, so I'm not sure about durability. We'll see how it goes.",Neutral
"Comfort: My main problem with this headset was that it is not very comfortable on my ear.  When I first got it, I couldn't wear it for more than 5-10 minutes.  Now that my ear has become accustomed to it, I can wear it for an hour or so.  It just takes getting used to.  However, I wish I could rotate the headset without rotating the earhook like some bluetooth headsets.  In order to have the headset have a tight grip on my ear (and not fall off), I have to rotate the headset so that it points upwards towards my eyebrows instead of downwards towards my mouth.  It's not really an inconvenience per se, but it looks pretty uncool.  Perhaps I have misshapen ears.Audio: The sound is fantastic.  Only sometimes does it get staticky in my pocket, and not often enough to notice, at least on my end.Ease-of-Use:  This headset was easy to pair with my Motorola KRZR and the main things I do (hanging up, answering calls, and adjusting volume) are simple and intuitive.  Only problem is that if you don't hold buttons for the correct length of time, it can perform the wrong function.  For example, pressing the call button once activates voice dialing, for 1 second redials your last call and 3 seconds turns it off.  I've done my share of accidentally redialing.Battery: I was disappointed when I learned the battery wasn't rechargeable and it instead uses a AAA battery, but the lifetime is very long.  It's supposedly 30 hours or so.  I can't verify that, I just know I've been using it for two months now without replacing it, and it's just a regular Energizer battery.Durability: I carry this around in my jacket pocket most of the time and it holds up well.  I do find myself accidentally turning it on when I lean against something, but I just need to be more careful.",Neutral
"I have to say, this was a shockingly good experience. I have had mine almost a year when I lost it. I found it the following afternoon, in the parking lot at work. It spent a day and a night on the ground in the rain and even got either stepped on or driven over, as the earhook was broken off. The unit still worked! It would wedge into my ear and I could still use it very easily-albeit uncomfortably. Why not 5 stars? Because the ear hook pivot/swivel loosened with use to point where it would fall out of my ear. I replaced with a 350 due to budget, I wanted to get a 655 but we'll see how this does.",Neutral
"I'm really unimpressed with this headset. Granted, its a pretty old design now (i bought it in 2006) and I imagine there are much better headsets out there.There is way too much static for such a simple, digital device. It is especially bad if I have my phone in the opposite-side pocket as which ear I have the headset in.Certainly you can do better than this by now. Get something with a later bluetooth version.",Neutral
"If this unit looks big in the photo, brace yourself: it's like a bad science fiction rocket ship when it arrives.  It is made of hard plastic with odd fins and protrusions everywhere.  It does not rest easily on the head.  It feels heavy and abrasive.  I am surprised that none of these manufacturers have come up with a softer, lighter material, or spent any time considering how to fit a headset to the ears and head.  Sony does a better job with its DRBT21G/B, but also falls victim to hard plastic and a hinge in the middle of the set that digs at your skull as time goes on.  Truly astonishing.I could not get the unit to pair with my top-of-the-line Sony bluetooth transmitter.  Motorola was ""kind"" enough to issue a stern warning about returning this item without calling their toll-free number.  What a waste of time.  They either don't answer the hone, or leave you hanging for long periods of time on hold.",Neutral
"Never got a chance to try it because you need all the Bluetooth things on your audio devices and TV. I am sure if I know a TV that comes with Bluetooth, so you have to buy the transmiter before you can use it.Anyway, the headphone fit *snugly* on my neck. And it is uncomfortable. So, back in the box and back to Amazon.",Neutral
"I paired it with my computer and cell phone at the same time, both for accepting audio streams. Pairing needs some trail but finally I can bond them. The pairing and re-pairing to my phone maybe because I have a ZN5.The quality and ease of use is very good. However, I have to get use to its behind of neck design. It is also a bit heavy and painful if you don't wear it correctly. The problem is that if you don't use it for a while, you have to take it off, or the narrow collar will squeeze the neck very uncomfortably.Recommended for ease of use, sound quality.",Neutral
"At airports watching people talking into space with some huge clam attached to their ear with a flashing blue light swore me off bluetooth. This headset from Plantronics is extremely small, nicely packaged, it paired immediately with my Blackberry 7100t.The packaging is very cleverly done and the headset itself is a simple silver cylinder and weights a mere 9 grams. Audio quality was high and a recent 7100t software upgrade increased volume levels to more than acceptable. A variety of included ear pieces ensure you're likely to find a comfortable fit. I've been getting about 2-3 hours of talk time on a single charge which while not perfect is adequate for most people.As a small minus, the button to connect/disconnect/turn-on or off takes a bit of getting used to as it feels a bit mushy missing a positive click to confirm your selection.If you're worried about compatibility, the Plantronics website provides a pull down selector for mfg/phone to confirm.",Neutral
"This is my second BT ear set.  My first was a Motorola with deficiencies in volume, talk time, not to mention how awkward it was to store when not in use.Plantronics has taken care of all of these areas.  This unit is plenty loud, even when traveling in a noisy vehicle at highway speeds.  The pen type slip case that goes in a pocket or clips on a shirt at the neck line is a good Idea.  By using rechargeable batteries (slides into the pen-style carrier) you don't even need to purchase a car charger or home charger.  I've purchased a small portable charger that goes into the computer bag I travel with.  Every morning, I replace the battery and the head set stays charged all day long.  When I say all day long, I mean it.  I'm on the phone over 3,000 minutes every month ... occasionally as much as 5,000 minutes. I love the Mute feature too; most BT head sets don't have this.The ear insert is the only thing I worry about down the road.  It is always exposed and vulnerable.  Not to mention the fact that it will probably discolor as it ages.  This is the only reason I don't give it five stars.  But, in fairness, if having the insert is the reason for the great volume ... I wouldn't have it any other way.I have been using this product for over a month now and I recommend it highly.Plantronics, one recommendation for you; make the battery rechargeable so I don't have to change it out every morning.  Charge me for it, its all good.",Neutral
"This is large enough to hold my I pod touch in an otter box case and my mytouch with out a problem, so my guess is it can hold just about any portable device or cell phone on the market.

I don't use the vent holder but it looks like it might work if I played with it for a while.",Neutral
"I've had another bluetooth headset for more than two years. I've never been happy with its performance-it was small and light, but at freeway speeds I just could not hear the other party.I purchased this headset four days ago. I could not be happier. This morning I sat it on my head for a long commute, and forgot it was there within 5 minutes. The road was wet, but even with the accentuated tire noise I could hear every word. I made several calls, and one person was not aware I was in my car.I have a slight audio discrimination problem, which makes it hard for me to hear over noise. This headset has a leatherette ear cushion that fits over the ear, blocking most noise. It can also be turned quite loud, uncomfortably so. This is great, because you are never wanting for volume.It comes with both wall charger and car charger, so I'll never have to carry this one in to the house to charge it.Look at the photos before buying: notice that this is a big headset. That's part of what makes it work so well, but if you want the compromises inherent in the tiny designs, don't buy this.UPDATE: After another week, I'm still totally excited about this product. a couple of days ago I ran a conference call from my cell phone, from the car. One of the other parties was on a lousy speaker phone. I could hear them perfectly.UPDATE AFTER ONE YEAR (January 2009): Just keeps working. Still pleased as punch. Battery still lasts forever.",Neutral
"This is a solid flip-style cell phone, in my humble opinion.I bought the phone for one main reason:I wanted a flip phone with a voice recorder feature.  While Motorola phones to come equipped with a voice recorders, the amount of memory that one is allowed to use for voice records is very limited.  With this phone, I can compose many short notes to myself, such as what items to buy from the grocery store, whom to call, what the license plate number was of the person who hit my car, etc.The phone's camera is also adequate for my purposes.  However, I'm not a big photo taker.  I have used the phone to document damage to my car (after I had a broken car window, for example).The data cable and free software pack is that you can download from Sony's website allow you to transfer images and sounds to and from the computer with relative ease, free of charge.One annoying feature of the phone: it takes a non-standard headset, charger, and data connection cable.  So, you cannot use handsets equipped with standard 2.5 mm connectors. unfortunately, I have not found a very good Bluetooth headset that works well with the phone.  So, one's best bet is to use the standard headset that comes with the phone.as previous reviewers have commented, the phone's screen does blank from time-to-time.It is difficult to use the voice-activated dial feature.  Recognition is very poor with this phone.  Motorola phones, in general, have slightly more sophisticated voice-activated dial features.It is also fairly easy to record conversations using the voice-recorder feature.  So, let's say you're on the phone with someone in the car, you don't need to have pen and paper in hand to take down addresses or phone numbers.  You can simply record the needed information and playback.  I often use this feature when I'm calling restaurants or merchants for addresses, telephone numbers, or directions.I've found that battery time is generally quite good.As with all cell phones, make sure you determine what features you want in advance, do your research, and purchase a phone that has all the features you want.I, for instance, am most interested in the voice-recorder that this flip phone is equipped with. I can live with the phone's other deficits.I would suggest going in to one or more stores to make the purchase, if possible.  I realize that is not always possible, particularly with phones that are not very popular or with unlocked phones, as in this case.nevertheless, if you do your research somewhat carefully and thoroughly, you can generally find a phone that meets your needs.",Neutral
The design is good and it would be an excellent product if the quality was anything more than terrible. The buttons to extend the arms worked exactly one time before breaking. Now I press and press and nothing happens. It's a shame because the rest of it works decently.The suction cup holds well and the tube coming from the cup is pretty sturdy. It moves a lot when the car is moving so you would need to rest it on the dash which would help somewhat but not perfectly.Overall one star only because with the poor quality it is worthless in spite of the few good points.,Neutral
"Almost nailed it with this one, Bracketron. First, the good: the mount is solid, it stays stuck to the glass, and the flexible arm bit is VERY stiff and hard to adjust but really stays put once you have it where you want it. Now, the not so great: the flexible arm seems to vibrate quite a bit while you drive, and the expanding bracket does not work as well as promised. In fact, the button on the side only seems to open the bracket if you have it rotated 90 degrees to the left (as in landscape, with the button pointing up). I took it apart and realized that this is because there is an assortment of rather cheap gears which rely on gravity to allow the button to only work in one direction. I much prefer my Grip Go, but if you need a longer mount and/or one with a bracket then this one isnt bad for the price, just not perfect.",Neutral
"My job requires me to take a lot of notes while I talk on the phone.  I have counterparts in two remote offices and we spend a lot of time on the phone.  Trying to hold the cradle with my shoulder while I type is horrible--it slows me down and eventually hurts.  A headset like this is mandatory for me.I've used other headsets before.  This one is really good (although I've used other Plantronics models that were more comfortable).This unit plugs into your phone, either into the external jack that some phones have or in between your phone and your handset.  When you take a call, just take the handset off the hook and set it on your table, and then push the button on the headset to pick it up.  It works great.This headset has a 300' range, which is great if you have to move around while you talk.  I've walked down the hall to pick up a print job from the printer and never had any drop in call quality.I do have one complaint about the installation though.  The jack where you plug in your handset cable is very difficult to access.  There is a piece of plastic molding in front of it.  They built a little plastic ramp to make it easier to slide the plug in, but it gets hung up on a plastic lip.  It took me about 15 minutes of messing with it to finally get the plug into the jack.  I was very close to giving up and returning the headset.  I'm glad I got it to work though.",Neutral
"I only purchased this phone because Cingular did not carry the new RAZR with the MP3 player and 1.3 megapizel camera so I had to settle for this one.  The swivel to use the keypad is awful, no one can ever hear me when talking, (even when I use the Motorola H700 Bluetooth headset), photos taken on a regular megapixel camera phone are better than the 1.3 provided here, can't listen to MP3 thru bluetooth, photos stored on phone often become corrupted for no reason at all, all photos disappear occassionally and I have to turn phone off and back on, too bulky and heavy, battery at times drains after only an hour even without any use, reception very poor and often have to stand in wide open areas.  Overall, I am very disappointed with this phone and only wish my contract would allow me to trade it in.  I am a gadget junkie and the reviews on CNET led me to purchase this phone but I truly now regret it.  Go with the new Motorola RAZR with the 1.3 camera and the MP3 player, same features in a nice slim package.",Neutral
"First, the White Screen of Death Issue.  I had 3 units til instead of returning tp Cingular.  I sent it back to SONY.  NO more problems.  They flashed it with the latest firmware and it works fine.  The WOD will seem to occur after you disconnect after a file transfer.  However, wait 20 seconds and the phone reboots.Pro: Loud and easy to hear from.Con:  Buttons and keypad is hard to get use to.Pro:  The camera is fine for a phone cam.Con: Battery drain is bad, when you play the MP3 player.",Neutral
"I have bought at least half a dozen cases for my s3.  I think I have finally found my favorite, and one that may make me stop looking for something better.

"Watch out people -- the notched circular connection on these ear cushions does not fit the opening on a Plantronic Voyager Pro -- the diameter is too small, and they fall out. However I ordered the ""medium gel eartips"",Plantronics Medium Eartips for Voyager Pro [3 Pack] pack of 3, and the connector on those does fit. So I'm keeping the gel eartips (not this item) and throwing out these foam ones.",Neutral
"I stupidly left myPlantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth Headset [Retail Packaging] in my car too long before realizing how the sun and heat were going to expedite the disintegration process of the foam covering of the earpiece.  I don't use my Bluetooth earpiece often, so when I did go to use it, the soft foam just crumbled in my hand.  I was irritated with myself because I had no idea where to get a replacement foam covering.I should have remembered all the times Amazon has come to the rescue!  When I found this foam replacement set, I was delighted because buying it would address another, nagging problem I've had -- the Plantronics headset picks up any slight breeze and makes it intolerable for the person on the other end of the phone conversation.  So, buying this set let me replace the eartip PLUS add a windscreen to the speaker boom, too.Putting on the eartip cover was tough because it's a TIGHT fit, and you wonder if you're going to tear the eartip in the process (I didn't).  Putting on the windscreen on the speaker boom was not as difficult, but it also was a tight fit.  I did have the speaker boom windscreen fall off once when I was transporting the headset around in my pocket.What's really nice is that still have left-over pieces to this set that I can do another repair job in the future (as long as I remember where I stowed these pieces!).Highly recommended!",Neutral

"I have no idea what they mean by ""Motorola Retail Packaging"", but beware it is not the same as the picture on the website.

While it doesn't look used, it too is just in a plastic baggie - no packaging like the webite shows.  I bought this as a Christmas present for my wife (to go with her pink Razr) - I'm sure she is going to be very impressed with the plastic baggie packaging.

"I use this unit with my Palm Treo 700w, which has a pretty lousy BT radio, so that may explain part of the reason why the range is so awful with this headset.  Max range with clear line of sight is about 6 feet, but usually less then 24 inches.  It is barely usable if the phone is on my waist in its holster.  Major disappointment.  My Jabra BT250 is better with the Treo, but not hugely so.My biggest problem with this headset is that people are constantly telling me that they can't hear me.  I have to lift the mic boom away from my cheek and then they will say ""Ah! Much better!"".  When that is only the case while I stand there like a dork with one hand holding the mic boom away from my cheek and the other hand holding the phone within a foot of my head.  This looks pretty silly walking down an airport terminal, and rather defeats the purpose of having a headset in the first place...I'll say this, though - the H700 performs the feature that I was looking for which was so bad with the Jabra BT250 - it actually stays on my ear.  I have small ear lobes, and the Jabra won't stay put - if I lean down it falls off.  The H700 stays on very well, and you hardly notice it is even there.  Very comfortable!Too bad the mic gets blocked by my cheek, which makes it worthless about 50% of the time.**Update 5/11/2006**- solution to muffled sound problem...I trimmed a tiny piece of adhesive-backed felt (the kind you put under bowls/vases, etc. you will have on your coffee table)and placed it on the little gray bump on the boom, just behind the tiny mic opening. This creates an air gap between the mic opening and your cheek - problem solved!A great headset with pretty good reception and wonderful form factor. 5 stars if they fix the mic hole clearance problem!",Neutral
"I've had my H700 for almost a year now, and not until recently did I learn it was a FAKE!  WOAH!  After reading the PDF on this page about how to spot a fake, I quickly learned the one I picked up on eBay was a fake.However, the headset has worked VERY well.  I compared it to a bluespoon AX7 in-ear headset, and I ended up keeping my fake H700.  Overall, it has been a very good copy, although not the real thing.  Very reliable.  However, I am still disappointed that I did not get the real headset.Is there anything I can do about this?",Neutral

"IMHO this is slightly better than the Moto HS850.  It's smaller, and lighter.  The boom is smaller.  But if that's not an issue, then both are equal IMHO.Now for the problem where people cannot hear you, or you sound muffled or away from the phone.  Wearing your bluetooth, look in the mirror and see how the boom touches your cheek or if you have a beard it'll touch that.  Note there is a very small hole on the inside of the boom that gets the sound.  Now anything that touches that will impede your voice....it's like putting a towel over a regular phone and talking to someone. Not you do not need puffy cheeks for this problem to happen.  Unless you have a very narrow face, chances are this will happen to you and you'll blame it on the bluetooth!TO fix this, get either Neoprene tubing or that sticky foam on one end (mole skin) and cut a small piece and put on the hinge near the boom then a smaller piece (if needed) on top of the other.  This will make a space between your cheek and the boom so people can hear you!  You will still be able to close the boom.",Neutral
"However I just did not enjoy the size of this behind the ear unit, found it to be too big. It is a little difficult at first learning how to slip this around your ear but after awhile it works out ok. Please note that you do not get to use your selected ring tone, it automaticly (Motorola hand set) defaults to its standard ring while the blue tooth is actively connected. You can turn the ear piece off then power on to answer in order to keep your fav ring tone. All in all it works very well, sound and loundness were very good. However, I just did not like the size of this unit. It is quite bulky.EDITJust picked up a HS850, now that is more to my liking, however I hope there will be no issues of a broken wire in the flip boom as the reviewer above mentioned.",Neutral
It got a lot of static noise. The connection was not good either. You have to put your phone within 6 inches away from the ear piece to get better reception. Regret for buying it. One useless item and money go down the drain.,Neutral
"Cliffnotes summation-  AWESOME well thought out easy to install product.......!!!Details-Purchased the CS55/HL10 after an Amazon price match locally. Been using the standard Plantronics corded headset for years on my old ATT 4 line business phone. I finally got tired of the corded limitations and researched this unit online.Basically the system installs nicely and the ""handset lifter"" is included($39 value)at the Amazon price. My older phone supports a headset but is not configured for the newer headset connection option which this Plantronics unit also supports. The lifter is simple to install and powered from the Plantronics headset recharger base. Handset and speakerphone capabilities are not affected by installation of the lifter device under the handset. You can use your phone handset if your earpiece is still charging or be really lazy and just use the speakerphone if your situation allows that.With the lifter installed you simply put the headset on your ear, push a button on the earpiece and the lifter raises the phone hand set about 1/2 inch out of the cradle and your line becomes active. Then dial your number or hit the your speed dialer on whatever phone you are hooking the system to. What really clinches the deal on this system is that you can use your older desk telephone without having to spend additional funds on a landline phone set.Wireless frequencies-The new wireless frequency standard is extremely clear and static free with my office Netgear N900 and DLink N-Wireless routers up and running without any equipment or frequency conflicts that plague the older systems that may have caused major problems in the past. During my test calls and walking around testing in the house the voice quality and signal was crystal clear at all times.Good installation instruction manual and online help if you need it make this a real snap to install. Let the headset charge in the base for 3 hours and you will be up and running for 10 hours of talk time if you need it..............Plantronics CS55/HL10 Wireless Headset BundlePlantronics is not the cheapest but it is one of the best and it JUST WORKS!!!!!",Neutral

I finally switched to the ""over the head""  attachment, which has a nice, padded earpiece and it solved the problem.

"I upgraded from a Nokia 6600 (which I loved but it wasn't the hottest looking phone) and have also had the Motorola A630.  This phone is nice, dainty, and has a great display, but it ends there:*) The speaker isn't loud enough, so you're always pressing the phone to your ear so incredibly hard and still can't hear too well - I called T-Mobile, they acknowledged the problem and sent instructions to the phone to increase the speaker volume to no avail.*) The slider is hard to get to quickly - if you try sliding the phone open, many times you will actually reject a call.*) Using call waiting isn't too bad - when you go to call waiting it is easy, but retrieving a call is painful*) Text messages - this is the worst ever - first, slide the phone open, create a message, hit the enter key, then recent log, then select your recipients, then next then enter then the message sends.  On the nokia it was create the message, hit the green button, enter your destination, hit the green button.*) deleting messages is worse!  select the message, hit options, hit delete (sometimes it's 4, sometimes 6), ""are you sure"", hit yes, done.  On the nokia, select the message and hit ""c"" and you were instantly done.*) bluetooth - it's supposed to be convenient, but NO, you are always asked if you want to connect - there is no such thing as auto-connect!  every time I get in my car I have to get the phone out of my pocket and unlock the phone, then hit yes, or I'll be nagged every few seconds by a noise.  Oh, and if I hit NO (when someone else is in the car and I don't want calls going to the car) it'll ask me again in about 5 seconds.  ARRRGH!This baby is going back!

"July 2007:Great form factor, mediocre features, weak Mac supportForm:As an exclusive candybar user (Nokia & Sony-Ericsson, both high end and mid range) I was trepidatious of using a slider. In lieu of a decent, nonflip, bluetooth/camera phone w/ Tmobile I went with this phone. Friends and strangers alike say: ooh how pretty. I say ...Pros:1. 1.3 Mp camera2. Bluetooth3. most vivid clear screen I've seen on a cell4. good form factor5. opens & closes very well well (1st edition I had was a little clunky, had a Samsung China sticker on the inside, 2nd edition I had (replaced due to bad mic) doesn't have a manufacturer's tag)6. far better reception inside buildings than my previous SE T610 (w/ Tmo)7. camera has great & funny options such as cartoon bubbles and image overlays which all my friends think are hilarious thereby enhancing the blackmail potential or storytelling function of my phone's camera - good times! This little feature is silly, but makes me smile so much; if all features of the phone made me smile like this, I would have kept this phone.Cons:1. lack of customizability- no ""favorites/shortcuts""- soft keys cannot be changed- cannot use .3gp files or .mp3 files as ring tones (on 1st handset (which I had for 3 weeks but which Tmo replaced due to a microphone problem) I could, on 2nd handset, this functionality was gone! I understand Tmo locks this functionality so you have to buy ringtones from them, whatevs Tmo!)2. lack of functionality- menu inaccessable during calls (cannot text or surf during calls)- no airplane mode- no notes function- poor Mac supprt- - does not work with Mac iSync (although, you can send numbers to phone from Mac Address Book (Menu: Card > Send card) via Bluetooth, which is at least some convenience, but not the convenience of iSync)- - my Mac OS 10.2.8 and OS 10.4.6 computers are unable to use dial up networking via Bluetooth or USB cable (despite the EDGE functionality and the claims of the sweet T-mobile techies who I don't believe)- - Bluetooth (via my Mac) only browses the memory card as far as I can tell, eg, sees pics only in the memory card3. GUI isn't well thought out - menu navigation difficult, sending text message requires a number of button pushes once the text is done (sending a text to multiple people is a major chore), finding files is not intuitive, submenus with similar functions are dissimilar between different apps (compare to the ""File"" menu on all Windows programs, it's the same because it makes thins easier, Samsung hasn't figured this little design STANDARD out)4. 1.3 Mp camera makes 17-40 kb sized pics ... WTF?!?5. problem with microSD card staying firmly inserted, aftermarket purchased card (necessary for music or multiple pics) pops outI will not buy a Samsung phone again. My phone MUST sync immediately and completely with whatever computer I have whether Mac, Windows, or Linux; currently the one I have is a Mac. Hello: Mac, Samsung, communitcate!! My previous phone, the SE T610, synched its contact list flawlessly to my Mac. The Samsung t809 database file type is currently incompatible with iSync. Don't believe claims on this or other websites saying the t809 sync's with Macs.Every single Samsung product (phones, home entertainment, etc) I have bought in the past 3 years has looked pretty and been supposedly loaded with features. However, each was loaded with glitches. No more Samsung for me!Wish I had gotten a RAZR (free or nearly so with Tmo), held out for a Motorola Capri, or splurged and gotten a fabulous unlocked Nokia (every one I've had has been outstanding).UPDATE as of November 2006:The phone is not as sturdy as I had assumed. After having placed the intact phone in my cargo pants pocket, squatting down while painting and standing back up, the phone stopped playing the mp3 I was blaring with the nice loud speaker. I took the phone out of the pocket and HORRORS! the inside/backside screen was cracked (the one inside the casing I guess) which voided the warranty since the Tmo warranty doesn't apply to cracked screens. Tmo sent me a replacement, but I sent it back because they were going to charge another $150 for this irritation phone.",Neutral
"I have had the PEBL for two weeks now and it really is as slick as everyone says.  Bluetooth and very good battery life are two of the pluses.  However, as other reviewers have cited, there are flaws:- The directional button is already missing paint in a few places from the screen sliding past it when the phone is opened.  If I am seeing paint missing after only two weeks, I shudder to think what will happen after a few months.- The inside is definitely prone to getting dirty with fingerprints.- The magnets require you to keep the phone away from your credit cards as well as items such as your computer.- The first PEBL I received rang only intermittently.  Sometimes it would ring and others it woudnt do anything.  In these cases, I would only know that calls had been missed once the voice mail indicator showed.  The replacement phone I received now rings with every every call.- Connecting to the Bluetooth headset requires a sequence of six or so steps and therefore must be done before turning on your car if you are going to talk while driving.  No way can I connect the headset while paying attention to the road.  I have always used corded headsets prior to this and I find this to be annoying.- It took a few tries to get the hang of the voice commands.  I would say ""name dial"" and it would keep asking me to repeat the command or tell me that the command could not be found.  However, then I noticed that there is a beep after which you say the command.  As long as you wait for the beep, the voice commands work fine.- The phone opens when dropped.In summary, if you want a very cool looking, eye catching phone than the PEBL is for you.  However, if you are someone who does not care about the appearance of the phone, I would recommend looking at other models because all of the problems with the PEBL make it only about looks.",Neutral
"Beware!!  I bought an unlocked Razr V3i straight from Motorola, to get the nifty purple color that's offered only on their website.  Bad, bad, bad idea.  About a month after I bought it, the phone started to act all crazy - turning off and on randomly, screen going dim, etc.  I mailed it in (the problem later turned out to be the SIM card), and when the phone was returned to me it had been LOCKED to the Cingular network.What the heck is going on here!!  I paid nearly three times more money than a comparable phone, to get an unlocked product - I travel a lot, and the last thing I need is paying Cingular's outrageous prices for overseas roaming and carrier services.So I called the Motorola customer service number.  And waited on hold.  And waited.  And waited.  And finally was connected with a very nice gentleman who promised he would have a supervisor return my call.  Well, that was the first call.  After a week of no return call, I called again - I wound up having to call a total of four times, with an average of 45 minutes' hold time each call.When it finally became obvious that nobody was going to return my call, I filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau, using Motorola's Chicago business address as the complainant.  FINALLY someone called me back, and - a miracle!  I got a new phone!However, the story doesn't end here.  I mailed back the old phone per the instructions, and a week or so later I received the phone BACK from Motorola's Customer Service - claiming they had already fixed the problem.I'm still waiting for Motorola to call me back to request their old phone back.  There's nothing wrong with it, except that it's locked to the Cingular network.The phone itself seems to have good sound quality and range, and it does hold a charge for a reasonably long amount of time.  That said, you can't save more than ten or twelve text messages on it, and you can't back up your messages to your MacBookPro.I bought an Iphone a while ago.  I'll probably still use the Motorola for traveling, but if I were you I'd think long and hard about purchasing a product for which it's nearly impossible to redeem the warranty.",Neutral

I guess ""branded"" is shorter than saying all that.This is not a ""clean"" L7.

"Update - Cingular sent me a replacement for my SLVR.  It has the same problems.  That's three phones out of three - two for me and one for my daughter - with the same problem.  Lockups and intermittent operation.  I finally figured out part of the problem.  Whenever an attempted voice dial fails, whether it was an intentional dial or an accident of pressing the button by mistake or pressing the headset button too long, then the phone will not make or receive any calls until you power it off and on again.  At least now, if I am really careful how I handle it, my phone works most of the time.  My suggestion is not to buy this phone for another 6 months or a year!Original review follows:This is a great phone when it works.  There was a report this week on CNN about the RAZR phones that were sold late February 2006 and early March 2006 being recalled for a software bug.  It is my guess that the SLVR, which is a close relative of the RAZR, has the same bug because my SLVR only works about half the time.  Most of the time, when I try to make a call, the display will say ""Calling xxxxxxx"" but it just hangs there until I click End, even up to 20 minutes with nothing happening.Any time I don't use my bluetooth headset for a few hours and then try to use it, the bluetooth on the phone will have quit working and to get it working again, I have to power the phone off and on again.My daughter has the same phone and has the same problems.When it works, though, it is a great phone.  The iTunes holds only 100 songs, like the other reviews said, but that's an iTunes issue - it treats this like an iPod Nano.Cingular is sending me a replacement for my SLVR and, hopefully, it will work better and have these issues resolved.  In the mean time, I suggest giving more time for the bugs to be worked out.  Once it becomes more reliable, I would highly recommend the phone.",Neutral
"I bought the SLVR for my wife and a RAZR for my self. People who want iTunes should buy their phones through a service provider who includes it on the phone. Our unlocked SLVR (apparently produced for use in Europe...it came with European plug and a US adapter)did not come with iTunes. Having read the reviews I expected this. My wife uses her phone primarily for talking and text messaging. The SLVR has worked well for this. The only issue is that some of the shortcuts don't work. The main one missing is the one which you use to lock your keypad so that buttons are not accidently pressed. We get this message saying shortcut not available on this phone. Other than this small annoyance my wife and I really like the phone. We're living in Hungary right now and the SLVR is not sold here, so it's extra cool for others to see. The small, thin form factor is great. I'm almost tempted to get one of these to replace my RAZR!",Neutral

You DO NOT get 25 feet range and to be honest you have to hold the phone on the same side as your bluetooth just so you don't get static.  I found there is no perfect bluetooth and their very expensive so this is okay if the range is the only problem I have I keep it in my pocket anyway.

"The MDA, designed and made by Taiwan's HTC, a leader in the Windows Mobile ""smart phone"" market (they seem to make all the WM phones sold in the U.S.), is really a cool concept.  It has a nice shape, a slide-out thumbboard that automatically turns the screen to landscape, and all the goodies that make up Windows Mobile: Pocket Office, Pocket IE, MSN Messenger, Windows Media Player 10, and tons of free software to download from the web.  Plus, it has wi-fi which works really well.I really wanted to like the MDA, as I decided not to get a Palm-based Treo due to severe syncing problems with Outlook (problems that were supposed to be fixed in the now-vaporware Palm OS 6 ""Cobalt"").  And I wanted to like T-Mobile because they are the only carrier out there that forces you on a one-year, not two-year, contract (and still gives you a rebate).  Anyway, after a few days I was sorely disappointed.  The problem lay entirely with the MDA's reception.  It was almost the same problem I had with the original Sidekick back in 2003.  The MDA's antenna was never able to grab a signal strong enough to make web surfing any close to being useable.  And it would constantly lose and hunt for signal.  It was frustrating to no end, even in the heart of Boston where a RAZR tmo phone had full reception.  I never got half the speed promised by EDGE, the 2.5G GSM data network.  Very, very disappointing.  Much, much worse than the EVDO services I had earlier this year tried with Sprint and Verizon.Summary: the MDA has all the potentials of a major league star except the ability/stamina to stick out for more than one inning.  It's a dud, thanks partly to HTC's poor antenna design and/or construction and partly to T-Mobile's poor EDGE and GPRS support.  If you can stand a two-year commitment, go with Sprint's PPC-6700, also made by HTC with the same sliding thumbboard design.  I haven't tried the PPC-6700 yet (cuz I'm pretty much broke now), but online reviews are mostly positive.",Neutral
"My consonants aren't well pronounced and my voice is pretty smooth--not loud. I have a hard time finding headsets that work. I was expecting this one to work well since it had a boom mic. But people still had a hard time hearing me. They don't have a hard time when I talk on my Samsung Epic Touch. So, this was a worse experience for my listeners. It doesn't have any noise cancellation, which might be part of the issue. It's a great headset for the price, but if you're a person who tends to mumble or be soft spoken, I would try another Plantronics headset. My trusty dusty is the Plantronics MX150. People can't tell a difference between that and the mic on my cell phone. I just keep buying them. I would love to find another since I have to keep buying the converters for the headset jack and that's been tough to find ones that work.As for comfort, I thought it would be better than some, but after wearing it for 30 minutes or so, I still get a little ear fatigue and need to take it off. The sound on it is pretty good. Better than the MX150, but obviously not representative of what the person on the other end is hearing.",Neutral

"This device is a small attachment for any of the Navigon 2100, 5100 or 7100 series GPS.For some reason, Navigon decided to place the charger receptacle on the BOTTOM (facing downwards) of their units. This makes little difference if you use the windshield suction cup to hold and display your unit. However, if you use the adhesive disc for the dash then the charger cord will likely have to be bent at right angles to make the connection, as its receptacle on the GPS points straight down. This device, when attached to the GPS, allows allows the charger cord to come in from the side, eliminating any acute bending of the cord.Conclusion:A helpful device for all Navigon GPS units; intend for those users who wish to have their unit mounted to the dash. 5 Stars",Neutral

I didn't know this when I got it, but if the Garmin is plugged in and not using battery power, it automatically turns on when the car is turned on (that's what I get for not reading the instruction manual, lol).To have a cleaner appearance in the car, I have the mini-usb plugged into the ball mount that is holding the GPS and not plugged into the GPS itself.  Unfortunately, that port is really close to the ball mount which restricts it's movement when plugged in.  With the adapter, it makes the cable less intrusive and makes the GPS free to adjust with the ball mount to nearly any position desired.  In combination with a 1.50 mini-usb cable, probably the cheapest way to keep my Nuvi charged while driving!!",Neutral
"I should say I right now that I don't own a cell phone so I can't verify the microphone part of this thing - only the music part.  It's a bit funky to get used to, like learning all the colors and flashing LED's, beeps or the controls.  It's also a bit heaver then normal headphones because of the batteries.  I recommend you don't read the getting started guide, rather jump right into the user manual.You should get in the package:  1 BT620s headset, 1 USB to USB mini cord, 1 AC adapter, getting started guide, and user manual, spare pair of ear cushions, and finally a carrying bag.I was a little overwhelmed of the things it says it can do, so I thought it had about 10 buttons on each side.  Actually, both sides have 3 identical buttons (the big center button, and up and downs (left: volume, right: jump tracks or FF or RW).  The left big button is for phone control AND turning the power on and off and activating discovery mode.  The right big button just pauses, plays.The user guide explains the the length of holding the button down does different things.  For example: to turn it on, press the left button for a second.  To turn off, hold the same button for 5 seconds.  To turn on discovery mode - hold it for 5 seconds while OFF.  Cool beeping sounds tells you what is about to happen.It sounds great.  All the buttons that are applicable work (all but phone).  Good range.  The manual claims that the purpose for the usb to mini usb is so you can charge and wirey listen to music from your computer.  But it didn't work for me - it only allowed me to charge.  But you should be able to charge your headset where ever there is a powered USB port: PC's, PlayStation 2!  It's too uncomfortable having a thick usb wire hanging and and tied to my PC while listening to music anyway.The AC charger is cool because it's wider instead of longer then normal AC adapters so you can fit another plug below it.  There was absolutely no mention of the carrying bag ANYWHERE.  It still won't protect from the elements or drops or crushing it.  It's cool for reusing it as little things I guess.As for all behind the ear headphones, lying in bed is really uncomfortable, especially if your a side sleeper.And, unlike the logitech, NO signs of cracking on the band.Cons: I never want to see the flashing two blue LED's (steaming stereo).  It is possible to turn them off but they always seem to find a way back on; a little heavy; no user replaceable battery.EDIT: 5/8/11It's been sitting in a box for years, so I charged and paired it up.  I don't know whats happened to it, maybe the band got slightly bent but it's really uncomfortable behind the ears now.I gave it to a friend and he too wouldn't buy it for dirt cheap.  It's pretty heavy and bulky on the sides too.  I know this item is long discontinued but look FAR away from it.",Neutral
"I came across David Pogue's review of Bluetooth headphones in the New York Times and researched the three sets he mentioned. Compared to the other's the Jabra BT620 was the cheapest and according to Pogue's review all the sets performed similarly so I figured i would give it a try as i have been eager to go wireless for sometime. I had 2 simple and common requirements - that it work with my Blackberry 8830 for calls and music and to be able to stream music from my PC around the house. The Former was a no-go from the start as i was told via email that the Blackberry lacked the right 'Profile' to operate with the Jabra as a music player. Since i already own a regular bluetooth headset for calls the fact that i couldn't use the headsets for music was disappointing. As a bluetooth headset the audio was actually pretty good since it covers both ears and cuts out ambient noise but the microphone was very distorted since the micrphone is not on a boom but built into the earpiece. I can not imagine that you can use these as a phone headset since voice quality is a secondary aspect of the design. After some futzing i was able to get the Jabra working with iTunes and Windows Media Player after installing a Bluetooth USB stick on my PC. However disengaging the headsets and trying to sync back to speakers wouldn't work on either application. The only way i could get it to switch was to reopen the application and in some cases reboot the computer. On the plus side the headphones are well made (for the price), comfortable for my somewhat large head and have good audio quality for most people who aren't audiophiles. The negatives besides the above showstoppers were an extremely short range without breaking up (15 feet seems to be the max)and on a minor note the flashing LED's which can be turned off but has to be done every time you recharge the device. Overall bluetooth promises simplicity but in my experience was anything but. What started out as a promising technology- connect all your devices wirelessly - became the usual gobbledygook of support calls and technospeak and incompatible standards that left one frustrated at the technology. I sent mine back to Amazon for a refund and will stick with wires for a while longer.",Neutral
"I love that I can use this wirelessly.  It's just that sometimes it drops out when I sit my MP3 down and I don't like that.  I usually ending up having to reconnect it to the headphones, but it doesn't happen that often.  Otherwise, I would give it 5 stars.",Neutral
"I got this to use my 5g iPod with my BT-3030 BT adapter.I got this over the 125s because I can potentially use this with anything that has a 3.5mm jack. And the 125s looked a bit fragile.At least with my BT-3030 it works very well.  It doesn't have a lot of range (40 feet at most line of sight) but that's not my concern.Only downsides are no user replaceable battery and it only charges with USB.  It'd be nice if it doubled as a USB to BT dongle for the PC, but oh well.It's a lot smaller than I thought it'd be.  So small in fact that Jabra should consider making an iPod sleeve with a a120s pocket attached. (are you listening Jabra?)The other minor issue is that when it's fully charged, the power button/indicator LED changes green, but not always.  Sometimes it'll go green after an hour sometimes after 10.I'd recommend this to anyone wanting to use a simple universal BT transmitter.",Neutral
"I use this transmitter on the back of my tv with my Bluetooth headphones. It works perfectly for my purpose and the battery lasts pretty long, given the size of this thing. It's really small, smaller than a matchbox even. Charges up in about 2 hours and will go for a couple weeks, with an hour or two of use per day. I did have some problems trying to get this thing to pair, it's looks as if there are no buttons, don't worry, it's there. The light is also the button, on the opposite side of the USB charging port, and the audio cable. Once you play with this thing for a little while will make you a pro at it. Then you'll have no problems. I definitely recommend this little transmitter.",Neutral

"As other reviews have said, this works quite well as a bluetooth speaker phone. However, the visor clip on mine kept slipping on the visor, resulting in the phone moving around.  When I moved the phone to the other end of the visor, hoping that being closer to the connection to the car instead of a snap that held it in place would result in less vibration and hence less motion, it failed to cover the road noise.

"I bought this phone after making a horrible purchase at Cingular with their LG320.  Terrible phone.I bought the W810 so that I could play music at the gym after my wife started using my Ipod.  And this phone worked out perfectly.  After sticking 2GB of memory stick pro duo in to the phone, I was up and running in no time flat.  The phone has really easy to use controls and the music quality was pretty good.The software that Sony gives you is also easy to use and easy to setup.  I was easily able to transfer music and files back and forth to the phone.  I loved being able to go out to Sony's website and download new themes for the phone as well.I'm sad to say that I had to sell my W810.  I found that travel was too difficult without staying in touch with email.  So I've moved over to a Blackjack.  However, I am so sad to not have my little phone around.  I really got attached to it.  It was an awesome little phone and would HIGHLY recmmend it.",Neutral

"I want to warn IT professionals that Verizon Wireless phone data email service is inappropriately spoofing sender's email address in messages sent from Motorola Q. This is creating problems with our anti-spam filters and I also believe this is unethical and should be illegal. We recommend against buying phones with this data/email service in our organization.When we configure our IMAP server option for the Motorola Q phone owned by one of our executives, the Verizon system is ""spoofing"" the email address as if the messages are being sent from our email server. These external but spoofed as internal messages get blocked by our anti-spam filters.When we wanted to try to ""white list"" (unblock) the Verizon servers on our anti-spam server, their technical support and Verizon representatives refused to give us the IP addresses of the servers from which email messages are being sent. This was probably refused by their network administrators for security concerns and I don't blame them for this. I'm sure they will agree with me that the problem should be instead resolved within Verizon's system software solution.Instead of spoofing a desired email address, messages coming from Verizon phones should have a distinct ""From"" and ""Reply-to"" addresses, with the first being any external Verizon wireless address, and the latter being the customer's desired and commonly used email address. The two must differ and only then the messages will not end up as spam because the sender won't be spoofed.Although Q seems like a good device, we advise against purchase and don't support their email integration in our organization until Verizon Wireless makes both ""From"" and ""Reply-to"" fields configurable. Small shops with Microsoft Exchange and loose anti-spam settings probably won't have problems like this.",Neutral
"This is the phone Cingular insurance replaced my Sony Ericsson W600i phone with.  Supposedly if they can't give you the same phone (which they couldn't because the W600i has been discontinued) they're supposed to replace it with something comparable.  There's about a $150 price difference between these two phones so I'm not sure how they figure these two are comparable but oh well.Cons: the speaker is way too quiet, the proprietary data cable is not included, the clear button is too close to the down arrow, and turning the volume up or down is annoying because it rings. I also have a glitch in my phone where it sometimes rings for no reason after adjusting the volume and the only way to get it to stop is to power off the phone.Pros: looks cool, slide function is fun, easy to use, stays locked, large display, lightweight, and slim.Bottom Line:  Would I buy it?

"Phone Experience:Its light and sleek and does perform very well as basic phone, charge every 2 days not 2 times a day as I use to do with smartphone.This phone's interfaces are so old that looks like I am using those old bulky Nokia phones specially switching from smart-phone. This is slow and very limited capabilities. Krzr seems to have lot better interfaces.Verizon Experience:At least I am not getting that many dropped calls as it was with Cingular. Its much better reception.Some things that I encountered so far are: Verizon charges you for 1 month advance monthly access fee, so your first month with activation will cost $250-300 excluding phone cost. Next, they charged me $15 because I ported my old number, in past I received this service free with T-Mobile and Cingular.Customer service is not friendly at all.Amazon Experience:The sad part of my story starts when I received this phone.I opened the box and it looked like used phone, with dust inside plastic protector and edges coming off and scratches where Mini-SD card goes. I thought its not a big deal so I called Verizon, they came up with resolution after couple calls and hold time that goto store for a free replacement. I went to store, the lady kept trying but nothing happened then a answer that oh may be because you bought phone from Amazon and their customer service should take of this.Ha, who don't know on this earth that Amazon don't care for customer satisfaction at all. There is no one who can help you.

"I don't really care about the multimedia features--when I want music, I use my Ipod shuffle and when I want pictures, I use a digital camera--so I'll focus on the device as a phone rather than a music/video player or camera.Pros--The looks and size, of course. I don't like carrying a wireless on a belt clip so love to slip this baby in my shirt pocket--Nice, easy-to-read screen. I wouldn't want to watch TV on it, but that isn't why I buy a wireless phone.--VZ Navigator. This was what inspired me to switch from Cingular. It is a fantastic feature. I've tested it about ten times and it has been spot on, with accurate on-screen prompts, voice instructions, and estimated time of arrival. It turns me right into the driveway I need.  If you miss a turn, it recalculates new instructions in a matter of seconds.  The only down side is that it works from the quickest route and has no way for you to override that.  For instance, I went to friend's house and it had me get on a toll road for a few miles.  This WAS the shortest route, but not one I would normally have taken.--Voice recognition system works great. It doesn't have to be ""taught"" and can access all items in the contact list, prepare a blank text message, or dial a dictated number--Clearest calls I've had in a wireless phone.  You sometimes hear ""the people I'm talking to can't tell I'm on a wireless.""  That's been my experience with this handset.Cons--Strength of reception not quite as good as a handset with an external antenna, even a stubby one.--I wish they hadn't taken away the vibrate+ring option.  The Razr has to be either on vibrate with no sound or ring.  I also wish there was some sort of external LED to indicate when I missed a call or have voice mail.  As is, you have to open the Razr to check this.  An NEC handset I had a few years ago had very nice system with different color LEDs.--Verizon's proprietary menu system is more difficult to use than the organic Motorola one and takes away some customization options such as setting hot keys. I also haven't found a way to turn off unnecessary prompts (""Do you really want to delete this missed call?"").  There is also no way (at least that I have found) to change the red band at the top and bottom of the screen. It only looks decent with some sort of red wallpaper.--Verizon has the phone locked down so it's difficult or impossible to add pictures and ringtones without paying them.--It's plastic (the Amazon review is just plain wrong on this point). I wish there was still the option of buying a metal Razr like the first generation ones. I would have paid extra for it.  Like all phones, I'm sure it will scratch with use and be more susceptible to breaking.--I could not synchronize the built in calendar with Outlook.  I subscribed to a separate calendar synchronization program from Verizon (iDatebook) which works well but creates a separate calendar rather than using the built in one.--The Razr uses BREW for applications so there are fewer available than in java.  I particularly miss World Mate for international travel (especially the currency converter) and a shopping list application.--It's CMDA only so for for international travel, I've had to unlock an old handset and will just buy prepaid SIMsAll in all, though, the V3m may be my favorite wireless handset of the seven I've owned over the years.",Neutral
"PROS: price ($5), great sound - both easy to hear me and those speaking to me, small, reliable thus far despite 10 or 15 drops/falls/etc.CONS: must charge in the provided ""charger case"", does not easily work with two phones (though I have a fairly simple workaround now), terrible ear attachment (that breaks when you take it off to charge the headset)For the paid price of $5 (assuming my rebate shows up), this was a steal.  For me to give this 4 stars, honestly I have had to use two workarounds:1)  I replaced the terrible ear attachment loop with a jabra ear gel I have left from an old headset.  It works much much better than the Samsung provided ear loop.  I have already broken both ear loops provided with the headset because you have to take them on and off to charge it.  Dumb design.2)  I activate pairing on the device each time I want to switch from my work blackberry to my personal palm phone.  It's a bit annoying, but for $5 its quite doable.I have received compliments on the sound (so much better than the wired headsets I used to use), it is great not to have to constantly fiddle with a cord that gets stuck somewhere, and with the jabra gel it stays in even when my 1 year old is banging me on the head :)Still, for the money, if I had to do it again, I would spring for the $15 (after rebate) WEP 700.  Similar sound quality, but you don't need the charger case to charge it:Samsung WEP700 Bluetooth Wireless HeadsetMy wife has one and loves it.",Neutral
"The WEP200 sounds pretty good, is easy to use and is pleasantly small, but the system for keeping it in the ear is nearly useless. It comes with three different sizes of these little rubber loop things that are supposed to create enough pressure and friction on the inside of the auricle to keep the device in place, but none of them would keep the little thing in my ear, it would always fall out.It comes with nice a little case that also serves as the charger.  However, this device also a little bit overpriced. So, on to the next one.",Neutral

"I first liked this headset when I got it because of the small size and easy fit without an ear hook. They are reasonably loud and easy to use (volume, On/Off & paring). Charging is simple: drop it in its storage charging case and close the lid.But first, it is somewhat tiny and so you either need to wear it continually in your ear (hardly cool) or risk it getting lost in a purse. And because it is so smooth it does not hang in a bluetooth carrying loop that I had on my cellphone case (slips out).The dedicated charging case is also very small and has a dedicated charger with a unique charging tip (does not work with a mini USB connector or most other charging hubs)But the most disappointing failure was that the headset would inexplicably disconnect from my AT&T; Tilt in the middle of a call and the re-pairing would need to be done all over again. When you are driving and expecting a hands-free ride, this is a pretty serious problem.So I am replacing it and hoping that Samsung has addressed these problems with the well-reviewed WEP470.",Neutral
"This is now the 7th bluetooth headset I've owned and it is far and away the best in terms of quality of call. All the others I've used will start to crackle if I put my phone in my pocket; some drop quality if I hold the phone or place any part of my body between the phone and the earpiece.Because of its size the microphone on the Samsung WEP200 is set far back on the cheek. Despite this challenge, the unit still manages to pick up my voice clearly. I receive fewer complaints from those I call.Unfortunately, the compact design appears to severely affect the battery potential. After 10 months of moderate use, the serviceable charge time of my Samsung has dropped from disappointing to worthless. If turned on but not used, the battery will last up to 22 hours. If used to make calls, the charge my last as long as 8 full minutes on a good day. This translates to a maximum of about 2 calls per charge. Often, I have to switch a call back to the phone to avoid losing power and possibly dropping the call. This is a major detraction from the overall value of a ""hands-free"" device.",Neutral
"Purchased August 25, 2007I love that it doesn't look like other Bluetooth headsets that are huge and flashy. Connectivity and sound quality are superb. I can't give it 5 stars simply because it not very comfortable to wear for long calls. It becomes painful to wear after prolonged use.",Neutral
"This is a great little item.  I stress the 'little' part.  You won't feel like the Borg with this in your ear.  As a matter of fact, you won't even realize it is there.  One thing I would recommend.  Get the little attachment so you can loop it over your ear.  It is available from Samsung for 5.95 I believe.  Without it, you will have an extremely hard time keeping the headset in your ear.  And, it is so small and light, you may not even realize that it has fallen out.  It will drive you crazy without this piece.  I don't understand why it is not included with the headset - it is that necessary.  I have looked at the more expensive ones.  I see no reason to pay the big bucks.  Get it!",Neutral
This is a very small unit & the piece that fits in the ear is rather large.  It is a very uncomfortable fit for my adult female ear.  The over the ear loop must be removed for recharging.  The button controls on the surface and sides of the unit are not difficult to use.I would not recommend this unit for anyone with smallish ears or large fingers.,Neutral

"First, the ear clip snapped around the clip that holds it on. Hmm, OK, I'll replace it.EVERY time that I tried to answer a call with that wondrous ""one button wonder"" I disconnected or worse, couldn't hear it loud enough. for whatever Allen Funt reason, this !!@?!! thing resets to the lowest audio setting all by itself. It doesn't fit into my ear(s) but sort of hangs over it on that damned cheap earpiece that never held right. Pretty much guaranteed to be a worse distraction while driving than picking up the phone itself: distractingly nonfunctional and some engineer's idea of punking everybody who buys it.This was a replacement for my lost Samsung headset that was a much better product, but gone, darn it. As such, I've relegated THIS absurd farce to a place on a shelf until I can conveniently find a way to extract some measure of revenge on it.",Neutral

"I have gone through three HS850 Motorola headsets. After the first one expired--largely due to the inability to recharge, brought on by exposure to pockets, etc.--I bought two BLT-04 cases to take care of the replacement headset I got. At first, the case seemed to be a godsend. It fit perfectly and clipped on effortlessly. Then I realized that it also clipped off just as effortlessly. I figured I'd be careful enough and kept the case. While packing boxes for moving, I did not notice that clip slipped off and fell into one of the boxes along with the headset. By the time I realized what happened, all the boxes were packed, sealed and ready to go to storage. It's not as bad as losing the set on a street, but, still, I am unable to use it until boxes get unpacked. Luckily, the price dripped from $80+ for the headset to around $30 and I did not hesitate to get a replacement. But I am not putting it into the case--it's safer in my pocket.",Neutral

"This is a very comfortable headset and was quite easy to set up with my Motorola phone.  The sound quality is as good as other headsets I've used, and people on the other end of a call have told me that my voice is clearer.  However, I'm VERY disappointed with how poor the battery life has been.  I get less than 1 hour of talk time and less than 48 hours of standby time.  I could go over a week with my old Nokia bluetooth headset.",Neutral
"It's been a few years now since I had this bluetooth headset, but out of the MANY that I've used, this was by far my favorite.  I could listen to streaming music with it from my phone and it stayed on my ear really well.  This is the only headset I've had where people could actually hear me all the time.  The sliding boom mic made a big difference.The downfall of this model, as other reviewers have also written, is that the rubber tips that hold the headset on your ear break off with time.  I used superglue and prolonged the life of mine for a while, but it was annoying.",Neutral

I really like the design but keep in mind you are sacrificing protection for aesthetics. It really only covers the back of the phone which in my opinion is the least important part. The screen is largely unprotected except for a slight lip around the edge which may or may not protect the screen but I have yet to drop it.You really have to press fairly hard on the buttons to elicit a response which gets annoying after a while. I solved this by cutting the button part out with an exacto knife.I have a otterbox style case for this as well but it adds too much bulk to an already large phone so this is my go-to case.,Neutral
Fits well on my AT&T Galaxy Note. Some holes might be a little at the microphone but no big deal. Dropped my phone once and it gave cushion to the fall. Thank god..,Neutral
"This case is made of a firmer material than the silicone cases, which is perfect because it doesn't stretch or get caught when going in or out of a pocket or case.  It hugs the phone tight enough that many people won't know you have a case on it.  At first I thought the case was making button use difficult, but then I took the case off and realized the Galaxy Note buttons are terrible even without a case.  It's not much more difficult with the case on, and you do get used to it.  The textured grip area on the sides is a nice tough as well.",Neutral
"This case is ok , but there are certainly better ones out there for cheaper.I ordered this case with high expectation thinking i was going to recieve a brand name product from Boxwave , instead i recieved a generic case with no branding .There are other cases here on amazon and other sites that are exactly the same thing i recieved for less then half the price this one is being sold for.For some reason my comments doesnt get approved im not sure why , just letting you all know my personal experience with this transaction .",Neutral
"I'm using this case with the AT&T version of the Note. It gets 5 stars for the high quality/price ratio. The material is soft and flexible, the cut-outs line up ok... not perfect, but they don't cause any functionality issues. I love the textured hand grips on the sides. The hard buttons require a little more pressure to push, but i prefer to have the covered over having them open, but recessed under the case. The s-pen opening is fine with my case, I have no problem getting it out. It does make the Note feel noticeably heavier than the naked phone, but there is a lot of area to cover on the note. It's not a perfect case, but I've paid $30 on cases for other ""iDevices"" that had similar issues. Boxwave shipped pretty quickly, but there was no tracking available.",Neutral
"At first glance, this product seems not as expensive as it looks in the picture. So I got initially disappointed. Looks plasticky/jelly.But when I put it on my note, i realized the benefit of having high grip sides. It was easier to hold my phone now, less likely to slip.And the back looks good according to my taste. The S design looks classy.It has a pretty good fit on my phone.",Neutral
"This was for my husband.  He said that he had trouble  with his connections but we did not know if it was the product, where he was at the time of using it or if it was the other parties connection.  I would probably buy this again though because of its design and the way it fit.",Neutral
"Although weight, sound and battery are good, I really dislike this headset's design. If you are a totally predictable person who does the same thing every day and never gets dirt on your cuffs, it's ok. If you are on the go, the wire clip will come loose in your pocket or in your computer bag. The pen holder doesn't do anything to shield the clip, in fact it adds weight that causes more force against the exposed headset. I had to recrimp the loop to make it tight enough not to come loose. The pen cap itself is required baggage for no good reason. Rather than give you a standard mini usb connector on the device, you must now haul this cap everywhere. Hey, I don't always wear a shirt with pockets. After two weeks I misplaced it on a trip and so the expensive headset is sitting on the shelf while I ponder whether to buy another useless pen clip or to cook up my own connector. There is no excuse for non-standard connectors and charging solutions, but watch this company do it over again.(several months later) I finally am tossing out this headset. The pen clip holder was eventually found and I tried to make a go with this device. I don't like to get rid of working items, but I have had the earpiece and ear hook fall off many times in my pocket and this last time, they fell elsewhere and are lost. Would you believe it couldn't even stand up to the pressure of the inside of my suit coat? I did get a box to carry it in, but that was cumbersome because of the charging holder, and now it doesn't matter because I would have to buy a new hook and earpiece. Just ordered a Motorola H500, lower cost, lots of color choices and very long talk time PLUS a standard mini USB jack. I got a travel case for less than $4. Got one for my daughter for Xmas and she proved it to be a better headset.",Neutral
"I really don't have a lot of time. That is why I shop online, So if I'm purchasing an item that is to be used to make life more convenient, like a Bluetooth headset, it really is obnoxious to receive one that is &34;worse than sucks&34;. This item did not even charge. Plantronics really needs to pull this item because it is really damaging to their reputation to have this out there for sale. I choose Plantronics because as a Regional Sales Manager/Road Warrior, I've always had luck with Plantronics. Too bad that this one was a lemon.",Neutral
The sound quality is fine... as long as you keep your phone no further from the earpiece than your shirt pocket. This thing has NO range to it. It's unfortunate because it has an otherwise solid design. The single rocker switch is slick and intuitive. All the design in the world doesn't mean a lick if it just doesn't work.,Neutral
"Plantronics makes the best bluetooth headsets you can get for the cost. No contest. I have made the mistake of purchasing Jawbone, Sennheiser, BlueParrot, Motorolla, Blue Trek, and god only knows which others. Plantronics is the only brand I've purchased more than 1 of. While many of these brands cost well over 4 to 5 times what this one does, none of them can compare on battery life, consistency of connection, or all around value. This headset does take some getting used to as the rubber boot on it slightly penetrates your ear, but after a few days you will forget you are wearing it. The only headset I've found that was easier to hear was the sennheiser, but it likes to stop communicating with your phone til you re-pair it and costs about 6 times what this does.Background noise suppression is stereotypical, if there's noise, the person on the other end will most likely hear some translation of it. The mic is not as sensitive as those found in the Jawbone, so doing something productive like washing dishes won't blow out the eardrum of whoever you are speaking with, but they will hear some level of noise(the Jawbone is brutally painful for that!). I think this is the 5th or maybe 6th plantronics I've bought, and I'm sure it won't be the last.On a side note, the battery, under constant daily use, should last you approximately 500 charges, or 1.5 years avg. This is typical for any and all bluetooth headsets. At a cost of less than $20, that means this unit will cost you barely $1 per month, as opposed to $10-15 per month for some of the designer headsets!",Neutral
"I can't even begin to tell you the hell I've been through with other BT headsets and the Treo 650. They all had pairing issues - either they won't pair with the phone or they don't stay paired.  And the volume was not loud enough.  I returned at least 5 headsets until I came across this one.  The sound quality is maybe an 8 out of 10 but the volume is unbelievable, and this coming from a guy that doesn't have the best hearing.  I can actually hear the person on the line - all the time.  Even in noisy environments.  No complaints from people on the receiving end except when I'm in the home and the mircowave oven is running (this will scramble almost all BT frequencies).  Buttons are placed well and they are very responsive.Initial pairing was a breeze and the 700 connects to my phone flawlessly on virtually every call.  In the two weeks I've owned it, I think it failed to connect on two occasions and I make well over 50 calls/day.  This compares to the 75% connect rate I realized with other BT headsets.Battery life is a 10 out of 10.  I charge the headset every day but I often talk 5-6 hours in one day without recharging.  Just amazing!  They claim 10 hours (which it may actually achieve) but I'm amazed it can actually make it past 5 hours.The range is not that great but I can't fault the headset as Treo is known to incorporate substandard BT electronics into their phones - which make the range very, very poor.  Once in a while, if the phone is in my right pocket and headset in my left ear, there is a slight crackling noise.  It's not bad though, but can be annoying.  Pulling it out of my pocket immediately relieves the problem.Whatever you do, don't attempt to test the buzzer feature when the headset is in your ear - the buzzing is LOUD when it's placed right in the ear.  But if you needed to find it if lost in the room, be prepared to make the room very quiet to locate it.  It relies on the internal speaker to create the buzzing sound.Nice to have TWO chargers available in the retail packaging (one standard wall outlet adapter and one USB charger).  The carrying case was useless but a nice add nonetheless.I would recommend this to anyone with a Treo 650.  I'm not sure if this headset will rate as well with other phones but I can guarantee you won't find a better BT headset for the 650.",Neutral

The keypad is also uncomfortable to use, like many ultra-thin phones -- just not designed for normal human beings IMHO.  Finally, VM's prepaid rate is just too high.

The call quality has been excellent, much like my 2 previous phones from sprint were (Virgin runs off of the Sprint PCS network for those who didn't know). The interface is clean and simple for anyone to use. The volume of the call is loud and clear as is the ringer - I have yet to not hear the phone ringing in my pocket (one of my biggest problems with my last Samsung phone). Virgin has really simple pre-paid pricing plans with a well organized and useful website. Virgin offers lots of ringtones and wallpaper online at 2 bucks a pop as well as celebrity voice mail & rescue ringtones.Now, the badButton size, battery life, built in extras.The buttons are very small and can be difficult to operate if you have large hands (Once the phone book is programmed this becomes much less of an issue). This phone will not stay charged for more than 1 day - even if no calls are made. I have to make sure I charge it every night or else it becomes useless - this is my biggest complaint about this phone. There are hardly any backgrounds or ringtones that come with the phone.

Not real fast getting the phone out, but with bluetooth so ubiquitous these days, there's less need for speed.

"The unit is not bad.  Other have complained of the belt part breaking off, and although I have not had that I would complain as I don't think it holds the phone 'snug' enough in the holster part.  Have had times that the phone just slid right out of the holster from sitting down.",Neutral
Case did not protect the front of the phone and it made the back square instead of rounded fits in holster well but I did not like the feel on the phone I sent it back,Neutral
"Snapped off the belt clip in less than a week just getting into a car.  Same problem many of these style cases have, look for metal clips instead of plastic.  This is a real problem with the Note 2 as it is big enough that it is only a matter of time before it snags on something no matter how careful you are.  And if the clip is cheap and weak, your phone is going to the floor and your holster is now worthless as the clip snaps off.",Neutral
I like this product a lot I wish it came in green or just other colors in general very satisfied,Neutral
"I didn't really care for this one. i don't use it that much because it doesn't give much protection for my phone, which is pretty expensive. there are really no *pluses* to having this cover...it was inexpensive and shipped quickly tho...",Neutral
"Update: other than having to do the thread trick to keep the phone from slipping out, it is a solid holster. I actually use it at the gym lifting weights so that I don't have to mess with the arm band. The clip is very solid after a month of use. I'd still recommend buying the other boxwave holster, assuming that it keeps the phone from slipping out.Update: I had to wrap some thread around the claws of the holster to add enough tension to keep the phone in place.I ordered this one, with the weave pattern, because I thought it would help the phone vent heat easier, and because a lot of people at work have the other case design with the softer rubbery feel and the stand.The 3 bad things about it are: 1) the material is very slick and the only thing keeping your phone in the holster is gravity.2) This case does not wrap around the phone, the edges are square. This makes the phone feel a lot wider in your hand than other slim cases.3) is no protection for the bottom of the phone whatsoever. Most slim cases at least have a little wrap around for the bottom edges, this case doesn't even try.The good thing is that it looks like they did put more effort into the belt clip.For the price, I will say it is okay. I will probably add some tacky rubber to the holster rails to keep the phone more firmly in place. That being said, I should have just gotten the other one.",Neutral
"This thing snapped.  The clip got caught on something and snapped right off.  There was no way to fix it, broken plastic.",Neutral
"I gave this product a 3 because the clip easily broke off. the case is good which comes in two parts. A hard shell phone case is fits really well and you can use it just like that plus a sliding cover with a clip. The cover works like a screen protector and keeps scratches from the screen. The only bad side is since the phone is big and when you clip it on your belt, the clip snaps off its place when you sit down. 2 occasions my phone fell on a taxi seat because the clip detached it self from the case. If I was not watchful i could have lost my phone. From that time on i keep my phone in my back pocket",Neutral
"It seems that, to date, no one has really created a durable holster for the Note 2, but this one is the best so far. The new lip at the bottom of the unit keeps the phone from falling out while holstered (Yup, other designs have had that problem). The belt clip seems more durable as well. I've owned at least a few different designs of Note 2 holsters now, and I've broken them all by simple actions like accidentally catching the unit on a door jam.This unit has held up better in the past week or so that I've had it (Yup, broke'm in less than a week prior). It's easier to retrieve the phone with the sleek design than some other bulkier, soft-rubber cases. I like it so far.",Neutral
"It was cheap but the clip broke in less than a week. The very first day, the clip/kickstand popped off. Just clipping it to my belt, the natural movement of going about my day would pop the clip off the case and the phone would hit the ground. After a few days of the clip popping off, and me putting it back on, the plastic that held the clip on broke. I definitely wouldn't recommend this.",Neutral
The holster does not hold my husbands phone. As soon as he puts his phone in the holster it slides right out. This makes him have to clip the case/holster inside his pocket instead of outside....which makes the holster pointless!,Neutral
This case plain and simple is ok. It tends to scratch a lot but this one is for the road and stuff. One gripe about this one is that the buttons are to recessed. Its hard to push the power button. More than the volume rocker.,Neutral
"Fits like a glove. Adds no bulk to the phone - my GS4 stays slim and light!The kickstand works, doesn't slide around, nice and firm. It clicks shut with two tiny tabs of plastic on either end of the kickstand, so I guess if over time those tabs break then it won't stay shut anymore. But for the moment, the tabs are really tiny and hopefully will not break anytime soon.The only downsides I can find are:a. hard to feel whether or not if you pressed the power/volume button or not, there's no tactile feedback when you push. They do work though.b. the screw(?) that holds the kickstand in place on the back of the case bulges out and makes the phone sit slightly lopsided when you put it on a flat surface facing upward. Not an issue for me, but didn't expect the screw to bulge out the way it does.Otherwise very satisfied.",Neutral
This case is far from what I expected. The kickstand is awkwardly placed and it doesn't feel very comfortable when holding it. In addition the case is really thin. I wish I never hit the confirm purchase button.,Neutral
"I like the product. It slips on easily, is not too bulky, but protects the phone. Glad to have this item and the same one of an alternate color.",Neutral
I didn't feel that this was a very sturdy product. It felt very flimsy but I tried it and was afraid to drop phone.,Neutral
This one actually fits and is rigid enough to stay on the phone.  The material is 'gel like' enough to glide in and out of my pocket without sticking to the fabric of my pants pocket.  It is easy to grip and the lip on the front is raised enough to protect the screen if the phone is laying flat on the front.,Neutral
"I bought this for hubby who works in a restaurant so having a thin profile case (to easily side in and out of the belt pouch) was a must. The stripes on the sides make it easier to hold onto. Soft tpu case slips right on and can easily removed again for washing. Good price too.The only downside about this case (and might not be for some people) is that because the camera lens on the back of the S4 protrudes a little, you should use a case that is a little thicker on the back to better protect the lens from scratches. This case was a bit thin in my opinion. Why Samsung designed this phone this way is a mystery.",Neutral
ordered my case 9 days ago..it should have arrived yesterday. there is no tracking but they give me a tracking number.....wheres my case.. you charged my card but no product..,Neutral
When I get a new expensive phone I want to ensure I have all the protection I need so I go crazy and buy all I think I need . Good product. Buy it.,Neutral
"I bought this but the buttons were a bit too firm for my liking and got a different make/model gel case version. If you have your phone in your pocket a lot without a lock screen this might be better though so your not accidently taking pictures of your pocket though. Overall good quality, just a little to hard to get around with the buttons for me.",Neutral
I like the &34;S&34; Pattern on the back.  This has a nice grip on the sides and protects the case pretty well overall.  Only con I can think of is sometimes the circular button at the bottom is difficult to press as well as initially starting to use the power button (have to break in the case).,Neutral
its not stylish or anything but it definitely works! the black feels nice and protects your phone overall. get it.,Neutral
"This review is for the BoxWave case with stand. The reason I have to say that is because BoxWave has NINE different cases on this one listing! I could understand if the &8220;Size&8221; option was for different models of phones, but to have be different CASES is just misleading, and probably saves BoxWave money on listing fees.As for the actual case&8230; I bought this because it was one of the &8220;Best Cases&8221; for the s4 as per Cnet. I don&8217;t know what the deal is, however this case is pure garbage! The cutout for the bottom microphone is so off-center that the microphone is actually covered! As a result, I sounded muffled to the person on the other end of the line. The cutout for the camera is the same way. For normal pictures, it is OK as it case does not block the lens, however it does partially cover the flash. As a result, you get glare on the bottom of the photo from the flash.The Kickstand is useless. There is nothing to lock it in place, so the phone falls over unless you balance it &8220;just right.&8221; Even then, once you tap the screen (ie: skip a You Tube add), the phone falls over. Also the hinge on the back of the phone causes the phone not to lay flat.I paid $4 for this case, and I got the type of quality one would expect for a $4 case. I WOULD NOT suggest this case if you are looking for a Kickstand case. Other cases on this listing &8220;might&8221; be a better quality case, however, I would not hold my breath. To be honest, the cheap quality of the case I received, and the deceptive nature of the listing, I WILL NOT buy another BoxWave case.",Neutral
"Delivered in time for Christmas.  It is just as described; durable, doesn't add too much bulk and would add adequate drop protection.  The only negative would be that the lip going around the screen isn't that raised, so I'm not sure of the level of protection for the screen if dropped.  Other than that, an excellent value that looks quite sharp on the phone.",Neutral
Did NOT fit correctly for my Samsung S4 (AT&T). I guess I got what I paid for. Be careful if you're particular about your case and want it to fit snug on your phone. This case is not a tight fit and is loose on the sides. I gave this case away or else it would've just collected dust in my drawer. I would not recommend this case to anyone!,Neutral
I thought this item was clear but it had a grey hue. After a few days of use it began to look cheap and dirty. I would not buy this color again.,Neutral
"Shows up totally deformed (top of the case doesn't even touch the phone because it was cast crooked), and I have to pay to mail it back to them if I want a replacement? I don't want a replacement anymore, I want a functional phone case. Definitely a &34;get what you pay for&34; kind of thing. The case is pretty inflexible, so when I took the case off, it also pulled off the back of the phone. Not the end of the world, but definitely a crappy case. Would absolutely not recommend.",Neutral

Great coverage of back and sides for protection, cut outs line up perfect.2. Pretty thin, doesn&8217;t add much bulk.3. Glossy sides add a little better grip.Cons:1. Made my screen protector bubble up on sides2. Very slippery on back but glossy bumper on the sides, helps make grip better, could be better.3. Power button is near impossible to press with case installed (Deal Breaker)4. Pretty Plain",Neutral
"4.5 StarsPros:It keeps the phone thin and adds weight but not a lot.Looks good (clear/white).Provides a little bit of texture and grip, makes the phone feel a little more secure in my hand (I found it a little harder to hold on to before, as in, it slid very easily on flat surfaces).Has a decent sized lip to protect screen when phone is set face down on flat surface (table).Fits my Samsung Galaxy S4 just fine.Cons:The power and volume buttons are a little harder to press but I was having trouble locating the power button without the case on in the first place so now there's at least some texture to help me find it (my previous phone had the lock/unlock/power button on the top right).Overall worth the $3.75 after shipping and handling. Haven't had it long so can't really comment on long term but overall exactly what I expected for the money I spent. Might even get the blue too if my opinions don't change in the next few weeks.*Side note: I use my phone very gently, this is not the case for people who are rough and tumble with their phones.",Neutral

"I have had the Galaxy S4 for a few weeks now and I have decided to buy a cheap case to protect it from scratching and cracking the screen.  I was a little skeptical at first when purchasing this case because I wasn't sure it would satisfy me. Before purchasing this case, I looked on Amazon to see what other cases there were and all of them were sort of expensive and I just wanted something that would get the job done while not being too expensive and this was the best case I could find.After getting the case, I can safely say that there's no other case out there that can beat this case in price. If anybody out there is not sure what case to get that will keep their Galaxy S4 protected then you have found the one. This case makes the phone comfortable to hold in hand and doesn't add much bulk to the phone. It fits perfectly with the phone. One little thing that bothers me is that the buttons (power and volume) are a little hard to press but other than that, it's hard to beat the price of this case.Pros:+ Makes the phone comfortable to hold in hand+ Doesn't add much bulk to the phone+ Fits the phone perfectly+ CheapCons:- The power and volume buttons are a little hard to pressOverall I am happy with the purchase I made and I'm enjoying this case. I am always very careful with my phones and rarely ever drop them. I don't need an expensive case but just one that will do the job. I hate having scratches on the back of the phone or cracks on the screen. I recommend this case to anyone who's looking for a cheap case that will protect their phones without spending much money on an expensive case.",Neutral

"This is the 3rd ""OEM"" battery I bought via Amazon Marketplace -- as with the others, it was terrible. I ordered form the OEM shop a BR50. They sent a BR56 which is supposed to be even better with 3 hours talk time. It did not last 30 minutes after a complete overnight charge. Nowhere as long as the battery I am trying to replace which lasts over an hour instead of the original 2 1/2 hours.OEM sent a counterfeit fake battery --- not OEM. How can you tell? Because Motorola OEM batteries are made in Japan. These say clearly that they are made in china. I had the same problem and returned the same battery from Wireless Phone Accessories and Batteries4Less.AMAZON_- you should be screening these sellers and addressing these issues. There are a ton of posts under every single one of the Motorola Razr battery listing that say they got bad or counterfeit batteries.Theses companies make their money by selling junk, counting on the Amazon customer not to feel it is worth the hassle to return it. For every one I have to return I lose an hour of my time. My time is worth more than th $10 I get ripped off for. But I do it anyway b/c hopefully at some point AMAZON is going to take responsibility for the conduct of their market sellers. AMAZON's new logo is to become the most customer centric company on earth. Well AMAZON, you can start here: Bargain Cell -- which is one of the worst offenders,Wireless Phone Accessories and nowThe OEM Shop -- what a joke for a name for the last one since clearly they KNOW they are selling counterfeit batteries.I paid $30 for one from batteries4less hoping to get the real deal -- I got the exact same batter I got from the OEM shop -- the exact same counterfeit.

"Even though my Nokida model, 6126, was listed as working when this arrived I thought oh-man they shipped the wrong thing. Then I looked at the model number on the cable and it was the one I ordered.

Yeah, and it's a penny, PLUS a lot in shipping!So, if the software works for you, it is pretty nice.  If not, you're out.  I gave a review of one star based on the fact that a model I KNOW doesn't work is in the supported list.",Neutral
"When installed according to instructions, this unit fulfills all its claims.NOTE that for the best success, you should separate the external antenna and internal base unit by as much distance and signal-obstruction as possible -- put the outdoor antenna at at the best available signal location, and the indoor base unit in the worst dead-zone.  Use every inch of the 50' cable supplied.My installation is in a steel-framed and steel-skinned building -- getting a signal inside was basically impossible. The outside antenna is on an old TV antenna mast 5' above the building roof, and the inside unit is sitting on top of a suspended ceiling in the center of the main area. Now I get 5-bars on Sprint anywhere inside the building, and 3-4 bars within 10 feet or so of the building outside. Our ATT data card gets a 5-bars signal also. (We are thus using both bands on this unit at once.)While not cheap, it is the least expensive alternative available, and It Just Works(tm).",Neutral
"Knowing the wide range of reviews of this product, I ordered it anyway and would return it if it really didn't work out.Here's the summary: I spent much of two days trying every possible combination of signal antenna location: inside, outside, 10 feet high, 20 feet high, near a window, in the attic.  I followed the instructions and kept the base unit as far away as possible, with as much vertical separation as possible.  I oriented the base station antenna vertically and horizontally.Nothing worked.  I called Wi-Ex technical support and their recommendation was to buy the additional directional antenna and aim it at one specific tower.  I decided I didn't want to spend more and risk still not having the repeater work, so I returned it instead.Now the detail.  I did quite a bit of background work.  I live in the middle of a nice flat part of Silicon Valley and there is no lack of towers around.  My house is a single-story wood frame; no big buildings around and no hills.  There are 3 AT&T; cell towers within 0.85 miles (I found them and measured distance).  The problem is that I happen to be located almost exactly in between and equidistant from these three towers, and apparently their power is adjusted so that they don't overlap a great deal.  In other words, I get three sets of signals, none particularly strong, and depending on specific conditions at any moment in time the strongest signal comes from any of these three towers at random.  So the phone is constantly hunting for a signal, and rarely gets one very strong for very long.The YX510 repeater uses an omnidirectional signal antenna, in other words it will see all three towers the same way my phone does -- varying in relative signal strength constantly.  It will simply repeat that mixed up signal.  Furthermore, the YX510 will ratchet its boost down if it detects a strong signal, which happens every once in a while.  So it is easy to see what is happening.  The repeater cannot help this situation and in fact makes it worse by occasionally ratcheting  boost down when it happens to get a short burst of a strong signal.  The end result was that my cell reception was no better with the repeater than without -- not better, just ""different"" -- I was stuck more often in Edge than without, but I did often have 2-3 bars as long as I was in line of sight of the base station and no more than 15 feet away.  Beyond that, I lost signal.The solution would appear to be to use a directional antenna and aim it at one tower.  This would potentially solve these issues: the phone would not hunt between towers and the YX510 would not get a wildly varying signal strength (I think).  However, I'm not ready to make that jump yet and will need to do some more research.I was also not very impressed with the construction or the instructions for the YX510.  I will want to look at other options (all of which, BTW, are substantially more expensive, but generally the companies offering them have longer track records).The YX510 with omnidirectional signal antenna is probably a good product when there is a single, dominant cell tower nearby.  In my case, with multiple equal-strength towers (but at marginal strength), it did not help at all.  Since Wi-Ex tech support knew the problem immediately when I described my situation, it appears they are aware of it -- which IMHO means they should make it clearer what the limitations are.  The marketing material and the installation guide are written to promote the idea that you just throw the stuff up and it should work.  RF just isn't like that.Thanks to Amazon, returning it was easy.",Neutral
"We bought this unit about a year ago and it helped.  We live way out in the sticks and are probably 3-5 miles (as the crow flies) from the cell tower.  Before setting up the booster we were lucky to get any service in the house.  Afterwards we could get 2 or 3 bars, but had to stay fairly close to the base unit.  Recently I added the dual-band directional antenna and our signal strength on both of our iPhone4's is maxed out at 5 bars throughout most of the house.  This product is worth the money as long as you remember to also purchase the directional antenna if you are in a far fringe area.  Adding the external antenna seems to increase the range of the base unit.Update (09-13-10): I have found one complaint.  So far I am on my third OEM power supply.  The little power block died at about the same time as a lightning storm went through and made our house power hiccup so I'm not sure what knocked out the block (yes, it IS on a surge protector).  I bought a variable DC power supply as a backup since I could not find a ""generic"" power supply that would work (3.6VDC, 2.0A). I also added a grounding wire on my outdoor antenna.  Since then I haven't had a problem.  All I am saying is I wish they would include a little more robust power supply with this unit.  I still think the unit is worth it, just think about an additional power supply if you are susceptible to power failures, lightning strikes or both.",Neutral

"Unlike Most of the Rechargeable Battery cases, PowerBear Lasts up to 2 whole days.

"I have tested this against the griffin dual output unit.I checked the charging current.This unit was charging my galaxy note battery with 70 ma.Griffin was charging with 40 ma! And the griffin was 4 times more expensive.I have not used these for very long. I bought 15 of them, because they are so cheap and because they actually do seem to provide high current.No idea how long they last. I assume they will work fine. I have not been using them much. I did the testing , just to stock up on a high current charger. This passed and I stocked up.",Positive
It worked great for the first couple of weeks then it just stopped completely.. so basically a small waste of money.,Positive
I love that it has two ports for my phone and ipod. Who wants to be putting too many things in one socket.  Sleek and convenient to store and I just love it.,Positive
"I have several chargers. Have more than one vehicle so I keep more than one of these in each. Nothing more frustrating than finding all of a sudden one quits working, and you have no way to recharge your phone. That is always when you need it most.  This one works well for any of my products.",Positive
I bought this a little skeptical. After I tried it I bought two more. It works great and so far it has lasted for about 3 months. If that changes I will update this review.,Positive
"This is a nice charger but you can tell it was made cheaply in China.  When it is charging the phone, the car radio gets LOTS of static.  Not so much that I have to stop charging but like when you are near power lines and the radio station is far away.So, no RF shielding.I gave it 4 stars because it works fine for me, but if you listen to the radio, you might consider it is more like 2 or 3 stars.",Positive
"This is a terribly awesome product in my Subaru's console.  Passengers love it, I love it because it emits a blue glow, because it has held up to abuse over the years and performs like new.",Positive
"I've bough a munch of different things like this over the years. Most wouldn't stay in the jack, or would give out after a few days. This one is GREAT!",Positive
it works great i like i can charge two thing at the same now i dont have to wait for my to finish charging her phone,Positive
"It came at last, good looking and the price was good and i believe it is worth the time I waited for it to come to me good job",Positive
great charger for 2 devices and i haven't had any problems so far 3yrs now,Positive
Purchased product about many a month ago. Pros: Loved it work just fine!! Cool Blue light feature when you plug it into the lighter!! Can plug in two things at one time....Con: Top clear piece came off easily overtime (I just put clear tape around the top) TOTAL: PROS:95% CONS:5%,Positive
"I bought this to charge my iphone and tablet in the car. works for iphone but not the tablet. I needed a stronger charge for that but this is still great for both iphoe and ipod together. it's cheap, small and compact",Positive
Works great. The blue led light is a nice touch in the car. We charge a Samsung and Iphone using this outlet. Nice low profile too.,Positive
"works great and charges ipads, tablets, smartphones as well as bluetooth speakers and headsets. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a universal car charger.",Positive
"I could only give this USB car charger 2 stars because although it worked fine for about 3 months, it subsequently died on me.Pros:-Has 2 USB ports for charging, one (the top) is 2.1 amps.  The bottom slot is lower, presumably 1 or 1.5 amps.-Fits well in my charging socket - holds tight.  I've had some that were loose in my charging socket.-Works well to charge my iPhone in the top slot and the bottom slot works with most Android phones, except the very high end ones.-Has a blue LED light to tell you it is on and ready to charge.-The USB sockets seem to be well made and tightly fit all my cables.-Pretty solid construction.-It cost less than $2.Cons:-It died on me after 3 months.I had really enjoyed using this USB charger.  It rapidly charged my iPhone and worked well with charging the phones of my family and friends.  The two slot design makes this design very handy; with a 1 slot design, no one else can charge their device unless I remove my cord.  Of course, after this charger died, I had to go back to the 1 slot design I was using before.After 3 months, I began to notice the LED light flickering.  It was less than a week later that is quit working permanently.  I'm not sure what the problem was - faulty wiring, bad design, I guess I'll never know.  I thought about getting another since they are so cheap, but then I thought better of it.  Maybe they are so cheap because they are simply disposable after a short period of time.For whatever reason, it died and I was forced to look for another 2 slot design - I haven't found one in my price range yet.",Positive
This portable USB Port car charger is a must have for people on the go.  Pair this with an extra or spare cord and you are good to go!,Positive
I received this product before I expected. It looks pretty good and It works with my Iphone (3GS) and my phone (HTC Evo V 3D). It is a good deal because It is not easy to find something like this for this price,Positive
"I have several of these, from various retailers, all the same, each made in some anonymous Chinese factory, all exactly alike.They're great. They really do work, and they do deliver 2.1 and 1.0 power as they say they will do. They do the job.You wouldn't expect much QC for a $2 electrical product, but they each work just fine.They don't last forever-- about a year or two of active daily use seems about par, then they suddenly die. So do have some replacements on hand. At this price, no problem.Yes, they work with both my iPhone and iPad. Also with every other USB device I've needed to charge.The LED light that indicates you are plugged in correctly is very helpful.These are great for rental cars and travel. If you leave one behind, hey, it's only $2.I'm totally pleased with these clever little gems. No complaints. I wouldn't be without a couple, especially for travel.Hope this is helpful. Happy trails, all.",Positive
good product at low price.purchased this looking for a smaller charger and I love Griffin products.Free shipping just took a little longer,Positive
"I use this in my car to charge my phone and my iPod as needed. It works well, but the bright blue light can be annoying when driving at night. Overall, a very good deal.",Positive
The idea of the design is a sweet idea but it wears off as the paint is over the case and not under a sealant or anything. It has a cool 3D effect but at the cost of the paint rubbing off.It is quite pretty though.,Positive
Another pretty phone case that I really love. I have many as I love t o change them around .thanks,Positive
"The case is not white, its more of a silver. It's still a very pretty case- it fit my phone perfectly. It took too long to arrive.",Positive
Defintiely worth the price...You should order several.  Most cases are $15 and up especially at the cell phone stores.  I can't believe the mark up on these things!,Positive
"Received this item very quickly. The design is even more vivid than expected. The cover is soft (rubberized) but durable. I have received many compliments. It was an excellent buy! I would recommend this to anyone wanting a ""good look"" for their phone.",Positive
"I loved the case when I first received it but shortly after, the case started to peel off at first i did not know what it was until i looked on the back of the case and it was missing spots. Guess sometimes a good deal is not really a good deal.would not purchase.",Positive
"The color is more dark in person, and this isnt the best protection case. I get a lot of compliments on the case, and it was easy to put on.",Positive
Simple to install and a great way to help protect your phone.My wife really liked the ability to change the look of her phone.,Positive
The case is pretty good. It dose have some scratches on one side of the phone but its every little. Other then that i like it. Ive dropped my phone a few times since putting on the case and it didnt break or scratch. Ive gotten many complements on this case and over all it was worth the few bucks I spent.,Positive
This case is afordable and yes it peels very easy but thats to be expected because its a dollor. I bought mine from Electromaster. It snaps on fine for me but if I were to drop my phone the phone would be fine but the case would surely be done for. its only a dollar so do not get your hopes up. it looks great but its for show not for protection. if you want your phone to be protected go the extra mile for an outter box,Positive
This is one of my favorite cases I have this one on my phone I really love the color a lot.,Positive
"This case for some reason is peeling, there isn't much left of the orginal skin, i  loved the case with pink being my favorite color but i wouldn't recommend this specific one for anyone.",Positive
Its rubberized doesn't look like it in the picture but it is It's really cute I love this case used it for awhile but I switch out cases like I do my shoes.,Positive
"Received this in about a weeks time. Very nice actually considering how cheap the price was. It's a pink/purple with black leopard spots and has a very nice feel to it. I haven't tried to remove it yet, but hopefully it won't give me any trouble when I do want to change covers.",Positive
"This is the cutest case EVER!  I love it because it was easy to apply.  I had to switch from the rubber one because after so many uses, it wears out like the bottom hem of a sweater that has been stretched.  This case keeps my phone intact and protected at the same time...WOO HOO!!",Positive
my daughter liked it for a few days and then i didnt see it anymore on the phone. Use your judgement on that one.,Positive
"Honestly I have always loved this specific model, since you can just take it with you on the road not worrying if you end up losing it or leaving it where ever you go. Though it doesn't exactly meet the fast charging needs of high end phones, it works pretty well on all of them, you just need to be patient.",Positive
"I've had this charger well over a year now, and it still works perfectly.  Most chargers would have broken by now.  The folding blades make this more portable than the chargers that come with some Blackberry models that have adapters for different countries.",Positive
"so far no problems, it charges fast that is what i need it. it doesn' have an USB as it specified, jus a direct wall charger.",Positive
Great ! So far.I had this charger before and it seem to last pretty good 3 years fits most phones except Iphone and Galaxy 5  but that phone can still use it in the right side of the portal it will Judy charge it a bit slower. When this charger goes it tends to loose it's fit firmly in usb and has a short.,Positive
Works well. We use this for travel and it lives in our luggage most of the year. For the low price having an extra USB charger this works great. Charges our Galaxy S3 and Note 2.,Positive
"I needed a charger quick and I didn't want to spend $20.00 at the convenience store for a short, crappy charger. For this price, the charger is great.Pros: The cord length is perfect if you have a tall bed. I don't have to struggle to see my phone when I'm laying down.Cons: The plug in is a little blocky but nothing to worry about. The connecter doesn't like to stay in place 100% of the time. It does NOT fall out but if you wiggle it just right it disconnects the charge. My phone is also old and the port is a little worn. That could be my issue.If you need a good charger for a cheap price. Buy this!",Positive
This is another great product and i will always order from here in the future. money spent well!! If you need a great car charger this is the one you need!!,Positive
goes into the lighter port a little rough but it charges the phone fine. I wish it had a little more reach so i could use the phone from the passenger seat of the car more comfortably but its not a big problem. it will reach pretty far because of the coiled section but this will put stress on the charge port of your phone which many people dont realize will eventually break it.,Positive
"I purchased two of these chargers for my sister and girlfriend. They both have Samsung Galaxy phones and needed a car charger so being the OEM fanboy I am, I swooped up on a couple of these for them while remaining slightly skeptical of what was actually going to show up in the mail at this price.I'm happy to report I definitely received 2 OEM Samsung car chargers in the mail in sealed bags with part  barcodes (the kind you'd normally receive in a new/refurb phone). Can't go wrong with the price and certainly can't argue with the benefits of OEM vs. generic (mA output and reliability at the top of the list!).",Positive
I bought this for my Samsung Charge. It works perfectly and is built as solidly as the $20 Verizon charger. I highly recommend this car charger and thanks for the great price!,Positive
"Charger works great. Haven't had any issues with it at all. I wish it has a retractable cord like some other chargers I've used, but other than that, I love it.",Positive
"The big store that is in every town now (can't say their name) either does not carry anything or is always out of stock. If they ever have anything is stock, it is cheap junk that does not last. I got this cord thru amazon for a fraction of the price I usually pay for the junk at that big national store. This cord works perfectly and has lasted for months now. I also bought at the same time 2 other cheaper charger cords thru amazon that work perfectly. Since this one still works, I have the other two to fall back on when this one finally goes out. This is a great car charger, and it does not cost near as much as the junk you get at the local store--not to mention this is the Samsung brand charger verses their junk.",Positive
Good lengthEasy to useVery fast chargingI would recommend it to persons who use their phone a lot.,Positive
luving it  right now will last about 4 mo so you cant beat the price for it I got 4 of them,Positive
"A very good car charger for your phones, charged my phone pretty quickly and quite affordable, I recommend it to anyone to have as a back up to your charger.",Positive
"The Samsung car charger has stopped working within a 6 month period.  I thought a fuse was blown inside the unit but when I attempted to change it, I've noticed that it doesn't come apart like most vehicle chargers.",Positive
Sprint wanted $30 fro the same item.  This is OEM and not third party after market. Bought two.  Work great,Positive
Plugged into the car and worked the first couple of days. Hasn't worked since. My phone does not even recognize it's plugged in.,Positive
This charger works great. I love the fact that the LED on it does not light up until it is plugged into the phone. Great bargain.,Positive
It is Samsung brand..works with my Android phones..Galaxy Nexus 4 and Galaxy S2 and S3...recommend it highly for anyone with a microUSB phone,Positive
I needed a car charger and this was very affordable and it worksgreat! The same thing from the store was three times the price.,Positive
"good oem car charger, i originally bought it for my galaxy S2 and later on that week I upgrated to the Galaxy S3 and it works prefectly fine, I would recommend this product",Positive
"I use this charger with my GS2 from Straight Talk.  This charger is working as expected, charges the phone fine and seems like a quality product, not flimsy and cheap feeling like some chargers I have ordered in the past.",Positive
Hope to use it soon.  My other one worked sometimes.  This one does not have the light on unless you are charging.,Positive
"es un cable para carro de excelente calidad , original de samsung , lo tengo algun tiempo sin ningun problema",Positive
"I went thru 3 car charges which they all either stopped working after a few uses or never worked to begin with.This car harder not only works it also charges my phone lightening fast!!! LOVE IT, LOVE IT LOVE IT!!If u are debating u can rest assured this thing is awesome.",Positive
"First, this is kind of cheap-looking, but I did try to buy the cheapest OEM car charger I could for my phone, so that's forgiveable.  The springs on the side don't have much force, though, so this is constantly slipping out of the 12V car port.  The cable is sturdy, but the rubber near the connector is kind of stiff, which makes charging AND operating your phone on the go a bit of a hassle.  It's held up well since I purchased it though.UPDATE:  Stopped charging after a month.",Positive
Works great nice long cord. Does the trick. Bought several of these to put in diff. rooms & one for work.,Positive
I have had 3 phone chargers go bad in two weeks. I can not say where I purchased them. Most chargers for cell phones are cheaply made. This one is OK I guess.,Positive
"I received this product in a very timely manner which was delightful, however, I gave it as a gift and was embarrassed to find out it was a defective item. I was reimbursed for the product but would have much rather had a product that worked the first time.",Positive
It worked fine for a few days then I had to change to cord........The charger itself working fine up to this point..........Rather than send it back I bought another cord from sprint for $19.00,Positive
"fast delivery, works well. Not very long.",Positive
Had all the marking of a legit samsung product but the cord stop working after 3 days. I'm not upset because it was very inexpensive but maybe you should spend a little more and buy a better product off amazon. When it did work it worked very well.,Positive
"First off, the charger works just as it should and all the ports stay connected just fine.People in other reviews were complaining that the cord was too short-- about 2 or 3 feet-- and that was what I was expecting. Instead, I got a 5 foot cord which is a bit long for the purpose I was going to use it for (in my car). Now I have a long cord dangling everywhere. That extra length may be a bonus for most, but I bumped down the rating due to seller's lack of description and/or consistency. Also I'm fairly certain the product image was changed because when I ordered it, a different style adapter was pictured... I was expecting a square shape with the USB port on the side; I got the longer rectangle shape with the USB port on the end... hmm. There's no way to verify that now.In sum: Good charger with good connectivity, looks and acts like it's an original Samsung.  Cord length and adapter style may vary as it seems like the seller is not consistent.",Positive
"This charger doesn't charge the battery of my Samsung Galaxy S2 (i9100) properly.When I connect it to my S2, the screen gets frozen and the cell behaves in a unusual (abnormal) way.",Positive
This charger is exactly like the original one that came with my phone.  It is most definitely a good buy for the price!,Positive
"works good with our phones, better actually than the charger that came with one of the phones initially , great price",Positive
I love it.  It charges my phone quickly and the cord is super long.  I leave it at home but will purchase another to leave at work.,Positive
I am pleased with this purchase.  The detachable cable option gives very good flexibility for use with other USB cable chargers.  Good quality for a travel charger.,Positive
much slimmer than I thought and it ads 125% battery. I am charged for the full day with this case.,Positive
"This PowerBear case is a lifesaver!! Charges fast, always reliable. I also love the glossy texture of the case. Highly recommend!!",Positive
"This is a very well built and designed case,with a very cool and attractive color. Phone dies too quickly without it",Positive
I was looking for something different to my wife and this case its strong and beautiful. Good price and i recommend it.,Positive
"Love it this case is just what I expected and I love the design, it is slim and protects my case more than I thought it would.",Positive
"this is really cute phone case, i like it alot, and it came in when it stated it would too",Positive
"Really cute but the heart doesn't really show up if you have the white iPhone 4. 3 piece case & fits like a glove, looks really cute. Shipping took about 2-3 weeks but really enjoy the case. Do recommend.",Positive
Other power cases muffled the speaker sound. This one had a great sound port on the back for clear listening.,Positive
This product is great. I like the kickstand on the back. The power indicator is very convenient to know charge pack status.,Positive
Not Many HTC one battery cases for sale and this one is pretty good for the price. I would give it 4.5 stars and 5 if the price was $5 cheaper.,Positive
"This is absolutely amazing, more than doubles my battery life, so I can forget about carrying my charger all the time.For such a good price, this is just the right deal. A++++++++",Positive
"My brother just got the HTC One, and I promised him an awesome case like the one I have for my S4.Super sleek look, fits well, doesn't get overheated and saves the day every now and then! Especially when GPS is needed!",Positive
The raised edges protect the screens from falls. The battery case looks stylish and charges me up. This case is fannnnntastic,Positive
fits well on the phone and it is easy to use. the price is unbeatable and the product works like advertised,Positive
The S5 is a fantastic phone. However because of its large screen the phone dies quickly. With the extended battery I am able to enjoy all of the phones features without losing power. Great buy.,Positive
"I think this case is an excellent choice, since it is not so bulky, the color is nice, the texture on the back is good for gripping, and it extends battery life. It's a life saver, and there isn't too much on the market at the time for this phone so I am happy with it. Bought both blue and black for me and my brother right after we got home from the phone store. Would recommend.",Positive
i was raving to a friend about how amazon has great phone cases and how cheap they are and bought him this. it didn't even fit his phone right. poorly made.,Positive
"Bought this for my new AT&T; Galaxy SII, the case arrived super fast, its fits the phone perfectly and snug. I have no issues with any buttons, and the rubber is in a smooth, sort of laminated finish. It does not stick to your pockets. Overall, I am extremely happy with the purchase, especially for so cheap.And just FYI: This is for the AT&T; (i777), or International (i9100) Galaxy SII.This WILL NOT FIT Sprint, T-Mobile or the AT&T; Galaxy SII Skyrocket phones. You've been warned.",Positive
"I liked the case, and for the amount of money paid, its a good buy, i personally like stronger cases, this is very flexible and indeed looks like a hard case, a little bit of more firmness wouldnt hurt.Protects VERY well the phone as well as the camera lens there is not one single part of the phone touching the surface of the table when i leave it there. Very Good purchase.",Positive
"Like most of the other reviews say, this rubbery case has a smooth exterior, so it doesn't feel like an uncomfortable sticky rubber.  While still appearing to have a hard shell, the rubber itself is fairly soft, and does a great job of protecting from falls without feeling too bulky.",Positive
"the case did not fit my phone; was a tad too small.  i could only get 3 corners into the case.  i wound up buying a two piece case that cost about $20 from a local store.  have dropped the phone so many times the case is beat to s***, and no damage to the phone.  good reason to buy a case, just not this one.my co-worker delayed in getting a case because he could not find one he liked, and broke the display screen, making his phone unusable.  buy a case, not this rubber thing.  i threw mine away within 5 minutes of it's arrival",Positive
I like the case so far fits ok my Samsung Galaxy S2 I like that is very shiny and soft to the touch. My only concern is one of the corners is not totally covered so it wont protect it from scratches or a hit there that is why I am just giving it 4 stars. Well for the price i think it is ok.,Positive
Don't expect more but it works well for the reason you buy.I was looking for a cheap skin case and was not willing to pay a hefty amount for the case at least for the initial period after buying my unlocked galaxy s II.Din't Expect much before buying.But it really does work well.4 $ with 2 day shipping free is really a good deal if you are looking for a perfect tpu case protecting your phone.,Positive
Be careful when ordering these cases. Not all Galaxy II's are the same. Mine was a Sprint and this one did not fit my pnone. It went into the trash can as it wasnt worth sending back. Otherwise I am sure it's a great case.,Positive
"arrive on time, good quality, functionally, recomend to protect the samsung galaxy S 2 I9100, fit exactly , recomend to the owners of this smartphone .",Positive
"I was expecting a bit higher quality product but it is what it is. I've used it for a few months and it definitely helped when I dropped my phone. But at this point, I am not using it anymore due to the quality of the product, although 'good', it could be better and more solid.",Positive
"there is a different between the size/design of Galaxy II that is carried by USA and what's carried by Asia.  I'm in USA, I ordered the cover for Galaxy II that i bought from USA, the cover didn't fit, and the speaker location is different from the phone.  I copmared the cover to another Galaxy II that is sold in Asia and i found that the design is different.So if you bought Galaxy II from USA, don't buy cover from outside USA",Positive
Very satisfied with my purchase. The quality is good and the shipping is quick. The case provides enough friction to enable a good grip on the phone. TPU (the plastic material where the case is made of) virtually resists oil and dust. I used to have an Otter box for my other phone. The protection is excellent BUT the silicone attracts dust like crazy. The S-Style pattern at the back is more of a personal taste - some people like it but some other may not. To me it adds some flavor to an otherwise plain black case. The protection on all 4 sides on the front panel looks sufficient (anyone dare to slam your phone on the floor to test it out?). I wish the top margin (above the earphone) can wrap down by a few mm. Overall I feel my phone secured in the case.,Positive
this case is better than i thought i love the feel and design and it is well made and doen not collect dust.,Positive
"This product arrived quickly. It fits my HTC and is easy to get on and off, I have no complaints.",Positive
"Great Grip, Great Style, Gerat Durability, Great PRICE! Lasts long. SLIM FIT! Should be included in every HTC sensation purchase and if it was it may have beaten the iPhone 5! Too bad HTC",Positive
"Well, went on the internet first....$14.00, then to a very well known store, here in Gloucester, MA, $28.  I was not happy.  Then, of course, I knew Amazon would come up with something...they did, $4.00 and change...it arrived promptly.  I cannot say enough about Amazon, they are realistic in their prices, knowing that people do not have that kind of money to pay for a wire,,for 14 or 28 dollars. I have never been so happy to get what I need without spending my last dollar for it.  Thank you again and again.",Positive
"I would like a extra cable for my smartphones at work, so I purchased this one. Nothing special as long as it is working, and it is.No complain.",Positive
"There is a difference in USB cables.  On some computers, including mine, the USB ports are underpowered, and some poor cables do not transmit data well.  I have purchased some cheaper cables that would not transmit data between my computer and my Blackberry Storm 9530.  This cable works great, even with my underpowered USB ports.",Positive
"I bought this micro usb cable because it was cheap, and that it is. I use this with my Nexus s 4g from sprint and although it does indeed charge my device it causes some major issues, such as screen lag, my computer not being able to recognize what kind of device this is, and causing my phone to constantly jump into car mode. So if you need a real quick cable for basic charging, this will do it, anything else...spend the extra buck on a higher end cable.",Positive
"I purchased 3 of these cables because they were cheap and got good reviews.  I don't know how people are getting these cables to work... but out of the 3 I bought, 0 have functioned properly with my Palm Pre!  The best I can do is get it to charge, though the entire time it is charging the computer is complaining about ""Unknown Device"" and ""Could not install drivers"" even though it works beautifully with the original cable.  The only setting that works is ""Just Charge""!  Each of the 3 cables fails slightly differently which makes me believe that each has a different flaw!  I've tried this with my Wife's Palm Pixi as well as used different computers and that failed as well.  Look elsewhere when attempting to purchase a cable for your Palm device!",Positive
"This cable is better than original.  Never any issues with phone recognizing USB connection, as the original does, when plugged to PC.",Positive
"I bought this recently and did not expect much, as it was only $2.99 shipped to my door.  For that much money, how can you go wrong?  So, I have not used it to transfer data yet, as it it plugged into my PC at work just for charging.  When plugged in, my Palm Pixi prompts me, just as the factory cable does, to transfer or charge.  I have used this cable about 10x to charge now, and it works great!  Do not hesitate to purchase this if you need another cable, or two!",Positive
"A good inexpensive cable that works like the original.  I purchased this cable because I wanted one that would work with the touch stone I just purchased.  After reading several reviews and looking at competing cables I deciding on this one.  While several inches shorter (40"") than the original it works well and with the touch stone.  I used this cable mainly for use in the car.",Positive
"The cable worked great with the pre if you need an extra one, but I suggest purchasing the whole unit--plug and all, not just the cable, because with shipping and handling it gets to be the same price.",Positive
not much to say about a wall charger except it charges my bluetooth perfectly.  I'm glad I bought it.  Thank you!,Positive
"The Motorola T505 doesn't come with an AC charger, only a DC charger. This makes a great addition to the package. You can charge in your home at night.",Positive
we bought this charging cord because the t505 only came with a car charger.  we now have 2 t505 with the 2nd one intended for use with connecting our bluetooth enabled phones with the home stereo.  this cord offers a convenient way to charge both as we are not in the car for long enough periods for the device to charge completely while travelling.  by bringing in the devices we are able to charge overnight to a full charge.  great price and no complaints with receipt of material in either packaging or transit time.,Positive
"It's true! This cable outperforms the original! When I charge my phone, it's chargier. The data is more datery and the phone is more phoney in general. If I wear the cable around my neck like a bolo tie, people like me better and I can run faster and jump higher.  If I circle my dinner plate with it, the food tastes better. Basically this cable makes everything better than the original. I'm thinking about getting a 2nd one!",Positive
"I'll never understand how one review can say this item works exactly as it should and how the next complains about it not working...for the EXACT same phone! I just don't get it. I decided to try it out despite the people that said it didn't work, and I'm glad I did. It's exactly what I expected and wanted. I actually bought 2 of these so I could leave one in my car and one at work. For only $4 and some change for the both...this was a GREAT buy for me and now I never have to worry about my Incredible running out of battery!",Positive
I use this cord to charge my phone in my pc at work and it works great. Doesn't charge super fast but charges it none the less.,Positive
this product is great value for the price. and it works like it suppose to. you can't beat it. you always need extra cords.,Positive
"cable works fine with my verizon Galaxy S4, it charges and transmit the data fine.However, connector tip(phone side) is too thick, it won't fit if you use aftermarket cases.",Positive
"The cable is good, but it does not fit the Samsung Galaxy S4. It does plug in, but not far enough in to hold securely.",Positive
I have purchased many chargers for my Samsung phone on amazon and honestly the quality is just so so on them.  Maybe I'm just really hard on chargers but I feel like they should last more than a few months.  Spend the money and get a good quality one.,Positive
it works great and came at the right time you can never have enough chargers for every where lol thanks,Positive
These were really inexpensive and they work just like I wanted them to.There have been no problems so far,Positive
"It was what I expected to be and works fine, thought it might have been a larger gauge of wire?",Positive
"Works fine IF you don't move the phone.  If you handle the phone, the plug works its way out within two or three minutes.  This despite a relatively stiff fit.  Note that the cord that came with the phone plugs in smoothly and securely.  That's my general-use cord now; this one is relegated to overnight charging where the phone isn't being used.",Positive
"This charger doesn't work very well. When plugged in, it shows that it is charging, but after ten minutes I'm lucky to get 1% more on my battery. I only use it now if my battery is low and I want to keep it from getting lower...that's really all it's good for.",Positive
"I was pretty upset to find that one day it stopped charging my phone, right in the middle of a long trip. FFFFFFUUUUUUU...",Positive
I really like this charger and not having the cord hanging around all the time when it's not necessary.  Item was received quickly and was as seller stated. The cord retracts in a snap when I'm done with it. It also pulls out to whatever length so that I can just pull it out a short way to plug my phone in and the cord is not everywhere. I recommend it!,Positive
"It works, that's about all that can be said for it. It charges my Galaxy fine, but cord does not retract. Mine came with a busted spring. Cheap enough I don't care, not worth the shipping to return. It charges, I suppose that's all that matters",Positive
"Initially it is a great charger at a great price. However, I've been through 2 now and they tend to not last very long. For the price though I guess it's still not a bad deal.",Positive
"love it for moving from car to car.  great for a mobile person. can pack in brief case or backpack when travel, without worry about cord hanging or wrapping.",Positive
"The charger works fine.  It was a great value considering how much they cost in stores.  However, it doesn't retract at all.",Positive
was somewhat concerned after reading some of the reviews. Price was great so I bought extras just in case. Quality seems great. Cord not quite as flimsy as expected from other comments. Love not having the cords getting tangled in car,Positive
I love the retractable feature as it hides away so nicely. I does the job just as well as a thick corded device. excellent product.,Positive
"Item shipped and arrived very fast. Item is perfect for my car & phone, very compact. Item is as advertise.",Positive
"I like how long the cord is with this changer so that I'm able to reach the night stand and table from where I plug it in at.  However, I'm not a fan of how long it seems to take to charge to full charge, nor how it atomically &34;stops&34; charging at certain times on it's own.",Positive
This is a very good charger to keep for travel and as a back up in your house. I use it frequently.,Positive
"I was very pleased with this item when I got it back so quickly because it was a gift. However, I cannot give a 5 star rating for a product that never worked.",Positive
"The Phone charger works, it charges the phone. However, while the phone is charging it continually beeps as when the battery is too low.It will not stop beeping while it is charging until the battery reaches a certain percentage.I do not think this is the correct charger to be using on the phone I have.Now I am worried based on other reviewers that the battery may blow on the phone and I'll have to replace that too.I would not recommend buying this charger.The charger from my old blackberry works better.",Positive
we've had it a month and it's working great. wish the cord was a little longer but it's much longer than the one you get with the phone.,Positive
"it works and it works well. i go through chargers pretty quickly so im hoping this one will hold up. so far, so good! the wire is thick and its well put together! as far as im concerned, its well worth the small amount",Positive
"Thanks for the quick delivery time. And, it actually is a quality note pad! Mom loves it, it was a replacement gift for another brand from another company that did not work, this one is awesome!",Positive
"Paid $0.32 for the charger and $2.81 Shipping & Handling.....Yeah, I know the shipping & handling was much more expensive than the charger was but I needed a charger that connected and this one fit nice and snug so I am able to charge my phone while sitting at my desk in my home office at my computer looking for work.....which is an all day job huh?  LOL!  Wow, I wish I could write reviews for a living wouldn't that be nice?  I think the total price of $$3.13 was a great savings compared to how much the retailers that sell the mobile phones charge anywhere from $10-$20.  Ms_Thrifty has done it again!  Stay tune to more reviews, Oh how I love Amazon!",Positive
Gave this 4 of 5 stars because the cord is waaaaaaay too short. Works well. Charges phone quickly also. Wouldn't buy again however.,Positive
Its a charger and it works as advertised. It also cam in the mail pretty quickly so I am satasfied with that as well.,Positive
"U can never have too many.  Bought this as a spare for purse, home and work.  Now I don't have to worry about forgetting it.",Positive
"Product came really fast, nice long cord, which was great considering factory cord is so short. Worked great til the third day, then I don't know what happened...at the price I didn't expect perfection, and at Sellers defense,I have not contacted them..it could easily be my own fault and I've been so busy...even review is late. (Sorry)",Positive
"Where you mainly use your blue tooth is when you need to be hands on the wheel...driving.If your BT is down on battery charge, this is handy.  I just wish the length of the cord were longer....I already had a plug-in in the charger nearest me....!",Positive
I have used this car charger for the last 2 months. So far all is well. Nice retractable cord. It retracts at the push of a button.,Positive
"I have not used this as of yet , however, my wife has without issue.I have the x50 headset and she has the voyage, it works on both really well.",Positive
works great for powering my Plantronics BT. i like the retractable cord so it doesnt have a long cord getting in the way. nice and compact and easy to store when not in use,Positive
"I was a bit wary about buying this headset in used condition, but was lured by the half-price price tag when compared to a new headset. I envisioned all sorts of shortcomings, but when it arrived I was astounded at the excellent condition of the headset. It is clean. No scratches. No faded labeling. It looked to be brand new. Oh yeah...it works great, too.&128077;",Positive
"I love that this headset stays firmly on the head with the band and firmly on the ear with just the ear piece.  The sound quality is great, and the ability to mute the mic is the main reason I bought this.  The mute switch is in a convenient place and has a nice clip to attach to your shirt.  The only reason I give this 4 stars instead of 5 is because I have had a lot of people tell me I sound somewhat distorted when talking on it.  Usually I can make it better by adjusting the mic volume (another nice feature) or by moving the mic away from my mouth.  Overall good purchase for the money.",Positive
"I've been using one of these for years!  I replace it with a new one when the old one wears out.  The mic is always strong enough to pick up my voice, and I never have complaints about people not being able to hear me.  The ear-pad is comfy, and I occasionally forget I have this on.  The best part is the adjustable amplifier - if I have distortion from the sound out of my cell phone, I can increase or decrease both the output from the cell phone itself and the amplifier on the headset, and I usually can maximize the sound and minimize distortion.  I don't have to hold anything with my hand to get the conversation through.",Positive
"Love this type of headset.  I use one at work every day, so I got one for home too.  I hate things &34;in&34; my ear, so this quality over-the-head type keeps everything where it belongs and I can wear it for hours with no pain or irritation.  Comfortable and lightweight.  Doesn't even mess up hair.  It includes a leatherette &34;cup&34; for the ear speaker, but I usually don't even use it, finding it comfortable even without it.  It converts to an &34;ear hook&34; type also, but I don't find that very useful.  The inline volume control and mute is nice, although a bit large and heavy.  Great sound quality",Positive
"This headset works fine, but I expected somewhat better sound quality for the price. Also have not been able to get it to work with my Samsung Galaxy, I'm guess that was an issue with the 2.5 to 3.5 mm plug adapter I got since it works fine with my panasonic cordless phone. Not sure if this would allow you to initiate a call on the cell phone, however, which is what I am really looking for from a headset since bluetooth headset sound quality is so poor.",Positive
"I bought this for its durability, but the sound quality was pretty low/poor; volume was low too.",Positive
"This is a decent quality headset and sound quality from the ear piece is standard Plantronics quality (i.e. very good). The 2.5mm jack means it won't fit on some mobile phones (this is smaller than a standard headphone jack), but for my Blackberry it's great (both 8820 and Pearl). As a bonus, I also use it with my XBOX 360 controllers (both with the attached messenger keyboard and without) for online gaming. Some people have observed that I sound a little distant with this headset while plugged into the wireless XBOX controller, but repositioning the mic to be as close to my mouth as possible fixes it.There is an adjustable mic sensitivity switch on the plug, but this doesn't seem to make any difference to people at the far end of the conversation.It's held up quite well over the past few years, being stuffed in bags and traveling around. It's not as cool as the wireless headsets (bluetooth etc) but it doesn't take batteries, doesn't have to be recharged and isn't subject to interference. I'll buy it again if/when this one finally dies.",Positive
I love the product even though I messed up and didn't know I needed a 3.5 so had to purchase adaptor.  I had a small issue that was my own fault and this company was outstanding with customer service.,Positive
These have great sound and my voice is clear to other parties. The volume switch and mute slider work well and it has lasted for some time.,Positive
"I've been buying these headsets for several years, recommending them to friends and associates and now I'm buying them as gifts for the headset challenged. You know, people who literally have pains in their neck from clamping a phone between their head and shoulders.These are wonderful headsets. I've used them with a variety of cordless and cell phones. As long as you have a 2.5mm socket, you're in business. Audio reception is excellent even for those like me with moderate hearing loss. And the microphones are simply top-notch.I've had only one break and that was because I crammed it into a travel case - and I mean crammed. With regard to ordinary daily abuse, these hold up well.All in all, an excellent value.Jerry",Positive
"A nice change for me - having a headset that doesn't slip and slide, fall out of my ear, or buzz. My favorite feature is the button that controls the sound level the recipient of my call experiences. The only time is doesn't work well is when the listener is also wearing a headset, and even then, I suspect that it is the fault of the listener's headset and not mine.",Positive
Before buying this set I searched a lot and did read a lot of reviews and finally I chose to go with this set. The screwdrivers are very easy to use specially with iphones.I had to change the batterry on my iphone and if Stanley screwdriver set was not there I was about to break my iphone.Thanks for making this set so helpful and easy to use.,Positive
Handy little set to have around if you tinker with electronic devices. This set has many uses for otherthings also. Product is as described and price is right. I recommend everyone having a set.,Positive
"I bought this set to fix a pair of eyeglasses that had loose screws. The smallest screwdriver in this kit was perfect for that job, so mission accomplished. The tops of each screwdriver twirls independently from the shaft, meaning you can keep a finger on top of the head to stabilize the driver while you're screwing. (Sorry, there's no other way to say that.) The box suggests these screwdrivers can be used for repairing eyeglasses, cameras, watches, fishing reels, hobbies, electronics, and small appliances. I think this set will come in very handy.",Positive
I like them but they are not super duty materials. Works great for the application but when I was dismantling a hard drive one of them stripped.  Im not too concerned because of the price. Over all good value!,Positive
"The Torx screw drivers work wonderfully and the tweezers work well, but the pry tool is too weak and ineffectual for the project I used them on.I bought this kit to remove the cameras out of my HTC 4G LTE and I didn't have any problems except for removing the small plastic portion on the bottom rear side of the phone.  The pry tool was way too flimsy for the job and I'm not convinced that it would do the trick for any similar function.I'd recommend this kit if you primarily purchased it for the Torx drivers but not if you require the use of the pry tool as well.",Positive
I had to replace the battery on my phone cause it had gone completely flat. Apple was charging a lot and this battery did the job perfectly for a lot cheaper and came with the tools.,Positive
"Installation was easy and the tool kit worked though the plastic tools are no the robust and will break if you tweak on them too much. The paper foil was coming off the battery when I open the package but folding back in place worked, once it's in the phone it is not an issue. So far the phone charges fast and the life is much better than the 2 year old battery it replaced. So far I would recommend this battery.Update: 4 weeks after installing this battery is would only last 5 hours and that was barely using the iPhone with NO voice calls at all during that time and no extra heavy use of the internet or anything. Drained it and charged from dead several times, made sure that location services, blue tooth, apps closed... all OFF and still drained. Got my money back and bought one for 1/2 the price and that one works great! Maybe I just got a defective battery.... A risk we all take when buying these 3rd party batteries.",Positive
"The tools helped greatly. I used the tools it provided and followed the instruction video on Youtube. Everything was done in about 30mins, for a beginner like me. The battery, which replaced my 2-year old original one, works well so far after about one and half months. It gets charged very quickly and lasted very long. For average user like me, the battery last for about 10 + hours every full charge.",Positive
bought tool kit to do a battery upgrade on my cell phone. since it has an embedded battery I needed to take the phone apart. like the saying goes when you got the right tools things go a lot easier most of the time.,Positive
"Used this in a phone I repaired, battery fit perfectly and seemed to work fine, phone was on 5 percent, left it for two days, then I checked and it was on 1%, seems legit.",Positive
"I must agree with Gary Tuscon's review. For under $5, even though the smallest flat-head screwdriver in here is 1.4 mm (too large for the screws that hold the links on a Seiko women's watchband), the quality is such that I will keep them. The case is very good and labeled very clearly. The screwdrivers have a decent weight as well and the handles turn smoothy.If these came in smaller sizes, with tempered tips that smaller sized tools need to be strong, I would definitely consider them as well.If I had one minor nitpick, it would be that a color-coding of the handles would be a great help, but really, this is an excellent value for the price.",Positive
These tools gets the job done. Had no problem I was able to finish less than a hour going to also buy two more for my friends. great deal and quality product quick and fast Thanks!!,Positive
Very pleased with this tool kit.  I have already gotten a couple phones repaired with this kit with no loss anywhere in the kit.  Would purchase again if necessary.,Positive
"This set has some very unique screw driver  heads, the kind of set you need for working on cell phones or household small appliances. You would have a hard time finding some of them.",Positive
"the torx is the only real useful tool in here for the evo4g. not a big fan, just use a credit card instead",Positive
Seem to be high quality compare with the cost. Have every thing I needed (or more) to open my Motorola Droid.,Positive
"I should've ordered at least two sets.  These come in handy for a lot of things, home, workplace, etc.  And as soon as others know you have them, they need to &34;borrow&34;.  Keep you eye on them!  Great tool for a lot of little projects.  Fair price.",Positive
"These tools are better than expected. The handles are hard plastic but fit my hand nicely and the the rotating tops work well. The tweezer ends match perfectly so they pick up small parts with ease. Similarly, the driver tips are well machined and accurately sized. Only the plastic prying tool seems a bit flimsy, but it nevertheless held up to some hard prying without breaking. In all, a good deal and I'm ordering a second set this evening.",Positive
Needed for my Razr cellphone to change the internal battery.  More tiny screwdrivers than I'll ever use but are of good quality for what I needed.,Positive
"After viewing some youtube videos on this procedure, I was able to swap the battery in about 1/2 hour (which included taking pictures and studying the insides of the iPhone 4S.The tools are good enough to get the job done -- I never felt that the tools were going to fall apart.  In fact, I'm keeping them around for other mobile phone work.The only thing I'd recommend (esp. for older folks with not-so-good eyesight) is a good way to magnify things so you can see what you're doing.  I use a big magnifying glass, 1.5x reading glasses (3x would be better), a headlamp (to add light where I need it).",Positive
"Pros- Good tool set if you need to take things apart.Cons- They came in a plastic bag (no case)- They're extremely flimsy plastic that makes me feel like if I use them over 10 times, they're going to break.I don't recommend this at all and would recommend you buy something other than this.",Positive
"i bought these tool to us for repairing my nephews iphone 4 but non of them were the right size, so if you buying them for the iPhone don't buy these",Positive
"Does not fit the 4s so make sure you are ordering the right one.  You will need tools, so I suggest you get one with tools.",Positive
I had to pop open my Samsung Galaxy S3 to fix it up but none of the tools I had worked or fit. These worked perfectly and fit the screws and took it apart with ease. Compact and easy to carry around.It arrived on time and in good shape. Thanks!,Positive
"I use these for electronics repairs.  There are several sizes and configurations to meet various needs.  The most helpful thing about them is the independently turning barrel which allows you to apply pressure on the end of the tool and easily turn the barrel/screw right or left.  They may not be the best tools on the market, but they have served me well.",Positive
"Nothing too special over here.  Just some screwdrivers.  Seem to hold up well.  I used them on my g-shock band, and they worked and didn't strip, so I was pleased.",Positive
"I got this to try and replace a screen, found out I'm not a phone repair person.  It did have what I needed, lacking skill needed to do the job.  I can replace my hard drive in my home computer, and add memory, this takes allot more skill.  If you have the skill, the tools are great and very complete.  I had everything the video said I needed, minus the skill.",Positive
very helpful and good quality,Positive
Could have been better for the price and wait time. 2 of the drivers are labeled as a 1.5 but are clearly different sizes. Also the wear kinda fast if working with tight screws,Positive
Very fast delivery.  product is as described and useful tool.  If  you need a set of these this is a good one,Positive
I use these mostly for electronics repair and they get they job done. Great for phone repair or and small electronics.,Positive
"You may not need these types of screwdrivers often, but when you do need them, nothing else will do.  They're great for tightening eyeglass screws or opening up the cases of small electronic devices.This is a nice set.  It comes with 4 slotted and 2 philips style in a variety of sizes. They seem to be well made and I suspect that they last a long time. The swivel heads allow you to put downward pressure on the screwdriver as you turn it to minimize the risk of stripping the head on delicate small screws. The case has a labeled space for each screwdriver. It's your typical plastic case with a snap top and should hold up as long as you don't step on it or drop something on it.  This set is a nice value for the price.",Positive
"It is chinesse(like almost everything in this world LOL) but they are really well done, and for the price they are a bargain.The screw drivers have a free rolling top to make pressure, and the body is rellay good, nice grip and 3 lobules ergonomics.The pliers are just as good as you can get, no problems with them and good finish on the edges, not like razors like othersthe prying tool is just what you need for almost any device you want to tear apart(besides the iPad) they have enough strenght to pry out plastics and even aluminun bodys of smartphones.There is to mini screwdriver, a flat an a phillips, I use them for electronics.Overall pretty satisfied, I would buy another one later on",Positive
Really poor quality tweezer bent like nothing screw drivers made of cheap plastic adhesive removing tool again cheap plastic you get what you pay for would not recommend to anyone who is trying to perform phone surgery,Positive
"Not the best ive purchased but it came with the right size for iphone 4 but the ones with the yellow handles are really just different sizes for a star screw, and none of them fits the iphone 4 star screw. You can always use it for another gadget though.",Positive
Once or twice a month you need a smaller screwdriver than your always handy six -in-one. This setfills the bill nicely. When you need it you need it. A must have.,Positive
this item came in a timely matter and fit the descrition the only thing that the plastic broke a little to easily but other than that every thing else is good,Positive
"Nothing fancy but is extremely useful when you need it! love the tweezers and the big writing telling me which tool is which size. Took a while, 3-4 weeks i'd guess, but was worth the wait! I'd easily recommend them.",Positive
"Like others have said here, the screwdriver set is solid and good quality and will last forever.  The issue of course here is that the screwdrivers are not a true jewelers set and will be too big for most jewelry/watch related tasks.  So if you are looking for that type of set, this isnt the one to use.",Positive
"I needed a new screwdriver set to work on laptops with, as most of my old ones have mysteriously disappeared. At the price, there was no way I was going to beat a set of Stanleys. The best part so far, to me, is that they come already magnetized. I put them to use the day I received them, and am quite happy with them.",Positive
now I have it. I can carry it with me and always have the perfect size tool for the little things that go wrong.,Positive
"I'm sure that there is something that says it will not come as pictured, but still I was disappointed.The tools helped me get the job done, but they also did not hold up well. The plastic plying tools bent and broke fairly quickly. I can't say that it wasn't user error, but they seemed very cheap.",Positive
"This review is for the iPhone 5 battery and tool set. I realize now that the company is selling several different items under the same listing, so the reviews can be confusing and not accurate.Like many other &34;power users&34; (i.e. slaves) of their iPhones, I came to the end of the usefulness for my iPhone 5's internal battery. After lamenting on whether or not to buy some of the cheaper options available, I went with the &34;you get what you pay for&34; cliche and paid for the extra assurance that I was not getting a cheap knockoff.The battery I received had a manufacturer date only a few months from when I ordered the piece. Who knows how accurate that is, but if you're taking it at face value, I find certain comfort knowing that my battery hasn't been sitting on the shelf losing it's potential usefulness in holding a charge for my crushing of candies.After successfully opening my phone, I can confirm that all the labeling and signage match exactly to what is on the original battery in my phone. Any copycat can do this, but it gives me hope that this new battery comes from the same manufacturers as the OEM battery.The tools worked just fine for me. I was able to pry the top glass of my phone off by using the tools provided in the kit. Do some extra research around properly removing the battery. Use the clear plastic sheet under the battery to help lift it up and separate from the adhesive. That was the most challenging part of my battery replacement. After two months of use, I can make it through the whole day after heavy phone use without looking for a charger. My life is complete again!",Positive
This was a great deal.  Easy to install and a direct fit replacement for the iPhone 4s.  Does what it should and hopefully it will last.,Positive
Purchased this to remove screws on my Samsung Galaxy SII but even the smallest tool in the set was too large.,Positive
"This tool set is better than expected. The machining and finish is very good. If used for small electronics and similar applications, this set should be durable.",Positive
This was a great deal for the set. High quality materials at a low price. I would recommend this product to a friend.,Positive
"Tools were required for opening GPS, iPOD, etc cases. Nice selection of sizes. The plastic wedge tool is easily damaged. A five star rating if it included a case (I would have even paid extra for a case)",Positive
"the Torx screwdrivers were great, the tweesers were substandard, and the spluger was very cheap, mine broke the first time i used it.  For the price you cannot expect high quality.  all in all it did the job",Positive
These were a supper price and while not supper strong they will do the job and you get a lot for your money.,Positive
I really needed the torx driver tools to fix broken Nexus 4 back plate and this kit worked great. I'm really glad to have it around in case I need it again.,Positive
"I tried two (yes, two) batteries and had to send both back because both were crap. I finally decided to spend a bit more hoping it would equate to more quality. Well that seems to have paid off (third time's the charm I guess). The battery itself replaced my old battery perfectly. It holds a charge well and reads the correct battery percentage. The included tools were a bonus. I already had a set of tools from replacing my wife's battery a while back. However these were much better. The old tools I had were stripping the tiny screw heads. This set of tools gripped the screw heads perfectly. Overall I'm very happy.",Positive
very handy tools i mostly use it when i have to fix soomething small like phones docks and other cool stuff,Positive
"very nice quality set of screwdrivers. they sell bigger sets on here for cheaper, but made by a different company. DO NOT BUY THEM. if you want a quality precision set of drivers. this is the company to go with.",Positive
"the tools are ok Just not quite what I  expected.  They were, however, better than the ones that came with the screen I ordered.",Positive
Got this to replace an iphone5 battery that was only useable when it was tethered. Now it holds full charge and is ready to go. Great OEM repalcement. The tools are nice enough to use again too.,Positive
You get what you pay for. They strip easily. VERY cheaply made. But I only needed them for a one time use and I didn't have to spend a bunch of money so I can't really complain. But if you will need them more than once...spend the money on good tools.,Positive
Good but if you plan to repair or take apart apple products this kit is completely useless and won't be worth it,Positive
Was about ready to send my Jawbone Era back. Then I ordered the Jabra ear gels. Now I can wear my Jawbone all day! Aliph should include these with the Jawbone headsets. And I intend to tell them! Jawbone Era is awesome too!,Positive
"I bought these to use with my Jawbone Era bluetooth headset.  The Era comes with 9 different options for ear inserts.  But I always felt like the earpiece was about to fall out, unless I jammed it into my ear so far that it became uncomfortable.Enter the Jabra EarGels...  These made a huge difference.  It fit perfectly onto my ear (the nub on the top goes into the spot above the ear hole).  I could wear this all day.  I wouldn't wear these eargels without having an over-the-ear hook attachment on my Era, but these have made a huge difference for the comfort of my bluetooth earpiece.",Positive
"The eargels fit to the earpiece is fine, nice and tight, but as far as actually getting ANY of the sizes to comfortably fit, FORGET IT",Positive
I got these for my jawbone headset. Many had said they work great. but for the life of me i cant figure out how you get them to work short of superglue and even then they are too quiet to hear so i guess they work on the jabra they are designed for but not the jawbone.,Positive
"When I first installed one of these on my new Jawbone II, they were fantastic.  They fit my ear canal perfectly, negating the need for the ear loop that came with it.  Unfotunately after a few days they started rejecting my headset.  The ear pieces would not stay on the Jawbone, and they would no longer stay firmly in my ear.  I tried washing and drying them thoroughly, but that only helped for an hour or so.  I am not sure what the fit problem is, but they turned out to not work for my Jawbone II and me at all.",Positive
these were advertised to fit the habra stone.  they did not. i don't know if they changed the advertisement since then but it was aid to be a package with the habra stone so i got it. not even one piece fit.  threw them away,Positive
"I purchased these because the original ear pieces from jabra were OK but left me pushing on my headset constantly trying to get it in my ear more.  Which, unfortunately, resulted in a lot of accidental button pushing and disconnecting calls.I saw these on Amazon and thought they were worth trying.  I loved that you get basically 6 ear gels in 3 sizes for both right and left error.I found a size that fit my ear perfectly and was able to use the headset without the earband which was a surprise.The ear gels are gentle and fit in the ear.  Only reason I am giving them 4 stars instead of 5 is that it takes quite a bit of adjusting and finesse to get the gel on the headset.  Also, while I enjoyed the product I feel it may be slightly over priced for what you get.But overall a great product and the sound is now channelled directly into my ear so I don't have to keep pushing my headset in to hear.  I would recommend this product to others who find the jabra sound decent but also wish it would go in the ear a little more.",Positive
people should buy headsets to fit these things bc they are so essential..A must have for any headset that will fit them,Positive
"These Ear Gels Work Very Well, Comfort Is The Main Reason I Bought Them, Fit The Ear Very Well, The Price Was Right, You Will Not Go Wrong With These Ear Gels, That Is Why I Gave Them Five Stars",Positive
Works great on ear buds. I bought these to put on my basic ear buds and have them fit more comfortable so I can wear them longer. Great for wearing in the car during long drives.,Positive
I bought these so my headset would be more comfortable...These hurt your ears just like the one that comes with it no matter what size you use. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone...Don't waste your money.,Positive
"Purchased the Jawbone bluetooth headset. It was just not comfortable, but with these all is great now. Could not ask for a better set of earpieces. Great use of my money to get these.",Positive
"Jabra makes, by far the best hands-free devices on the market.  This particular model, the EarBoom, is not with it's faults.  However, it will meet your needs for the most part if you figure out it's peculiarities.Jabra provides multiple ear gels for comfort and for left ear or right ear use.  The criticism that they are hard to get used to is valid.  You have to try putting them in different ways till you figure it out.  The instructions are not a substitute for trial and error I suppose.As for the hands-free jack on your phone, you have to make sure you have a 2.5 millimeter jack.  That is the one with 2 stripes on the plug.  Unfortunately, a specific compatibility list is hard to come by.  Look at the specs for your phone and give it a try.The microphone will capture sound just fine, despite the short arm.  If you find people are telling you your voice is muffled, you must slighly twist the microphone head.  I have found that sometimes, if it is at the wrong angle, it will not capture sound as well.  The arm is flexible enough that it can be adjusted slightly.I also prefer the EarWave Boom or the EarWrap, which have wraparound ear attachments and a slightly longer more solid arm.  The Jabra EarWave Bud doesn't have a microphone arm, but instead has the small mic on the cable with a clip to attach it to your tie.  Personally I don't like those models.  I have not found much difference in sound quality, though the EarWave Boom and the EarWrap are somehow easier to figure out.For difficulty of use and for a microphone arm style that I just don't like, I have docked this unit 2 stars.  It should be noted that none of Jabra's newer models have this microphone arm any longer  But this is good bang for the buck.  Try other higher end models if you are more demanding, like I am, and are willing to spend the money.",Positive
"Yeah, I know, they warned me; but I thought I was smarter than the average bear- not so.If you have auto reverse on your tape player and you cannot shut the feature off, this will not work.  It may work for a few minutes at a time, but will always end up frustrating you by switching every few minutes.If you can turn off the auto reverse (or don't have it), it's a very solid product that sounded great.For those like me who need a FM transmitter instead of the tape version, I'd suggest the Soundkase FM Transmitter for iPod & MP3s.  We've been using it for a week or 2 with good results (and from my research, probably the best results you can get if you can't use a tape connection).",Positive
"Good Item, BUT.....The sound could be better...U get what u Pay For!!$8.00 for this as opposed to minimum $130 for a CHEAP CD installed in the dash.Well worth the couple of $$$",Positive
Not really worth getting.Except for very limited application this is not an good way to connect a audio device to the car stereo.this item creates a bunch of mechanical noise and in addition the sound quality from the attached device is very poor. It works but is not worth listening to unless one has to.  As limited as the fm transmitters are they have significantly better sound quality.  I'd return this except it would cost more to ship than it is worth.,Positive
"Great for the price.  Sound quality is not what it should be, I think, but my kids love it.  I like the idea and am going to buy one for my car, but a different brand to see if there is a difference in sound.",Positive
"I was worried about having problems with the Auto Reverse, but it worked the very first time in my '05 Audi A4 with factory stereo. The sound quality isn't CD level, but then again its better than my old FM transmitter.",Positive
"Purchased this to try out in the workplace. Don't have access to a decent sound system, so wanted to be able to pipe some mp3s through the clunky boom boxes that are available, without having to lug around a CD case. I was very pleased to find the sound quality is excellent. Playing mp3s from a phone or player sounds more clear and louder than if I were to tune in a radio station. This model had some of the best reviews on the site, and it appears to be a good unit so far. I had to go with 5 stars because you can't beat the price for something that works this well.**Update** It has been about a couple of months so I thought I should add that this unit has worked out great so far. It gets many hours of use and delivers very clean sound. I couldn't be happier with this purchase.",Positive
"I have been using this Coby CA-747 Cassette Adapter for more than 2 years to use my car stereo to play audio of my DVD-player and CD-player. Until lately, my car tape player kept rejecting it out. I thought it was broken and I was about to buy this same product from Amaonz again. While reading some other people's reviews, I bump into R. Penny's feedback on 10/26/05 about the ""skip"" mode as following:""One thing to keep in mind when using any product like this - some (but not all) car tape players have a ""skip"" mode. When a tape player's ""skip"" mode is active, it listens for silent portions of the tape. If it is detects any silence for more than a few seconds, it will automatically go into fast forward until it ""hears"" sound again. If your tape player has a ""skip"" mode, be sure to cancel this mode - i.e., put the player in ""normal"" play mode. Otherwise, you will find the tape player trying to ""fast forward"" over any silent portions of your audio feed.""This is exactly the problem that I was having. By turning off the ""skip"" mode of the car tape player, my car tape player does not reject the Coby Cassette Adapter anymore.Again, even if it is indeed broken, I will buy the same product again. Very good product for the money.",Positive
"I bought this cassette adapter to replace my old one who's cord got ripped in half when stuck in my door. I get better sound out of this one than I did from my other one that I originally bought for more than twice the price.The best part of this cassette adapter is that the cord is coiled, and can be stretched to be super long (probably at least 8 feet although I have not checked) yet when no tension is applied (during normal use or storage) the cord is only about 3 feet long. This keeps it from getting stuck in things like car doors or wrapped around steering wheels or getting all tangled which my old adapter did.I am very pleasantly surprised at this adapter. I more than got my money's worth out of it.",Positive
works great in my 2002 honda accord!  other adapters have either gimped the frequency range or only come out of one speaker.,Positive
"Just for kicks I did a ""local order"" at 2am Monday morning because it said the package would still arrive on Monday. I didn't believe it, so I figured, ""I'll pay for that and when it doesn't arrive on time I'll get my money back for the shipping cost"" (I mean come on, it was 300 miles south of me!!).  Only 12 hours later the package had come 300 miles onto my doorstep.  That my friends is dedication to one's time commitment. Wow.As far as the product goes I love it! The plug is the stretchy spiral type so it doesn't hang around getting tangled on my feet while I'm driving.  It was way better than that last stupid cheap one I bought at best buy that the cord wore out on after 2 months.  The sound quality is really not bad once you learn how to adjust the volumes properly. Everything you should expect from a cassette adapter.In order to get the volumes adjusted for optimal sound quality (without that white noise the tape players give off), adjust your phone or other mobile music device to 75% volume and keep it there while plugged in.  From this point just use your car's volume to amplify the volume.Good luck!",Positive
This item doestn work on 2001 Chevy suburban.I tried too many things to get it work but no chances anyways dual position thing is good for using with different players.,Positive
"I have a cassette player in my car and wanted to be able to plug my MP3 player into it. This adapter looks like a cassette with a wire coming out of the end. It slides into my car player and when I plug it up to my mp3 player, it plays through the system with no problem. I have not had any trouble from it yet as others have written about. I went on a trip 2 weeks ago and used it for several hours. It worked great.  The wire can be changed to come out of the side or the back, depending on which way your auto player is oriented.",Positive
"I was using an FM modulator, but didn't like that with my iPhone, it would create feedback in the car speakers, so I decided to switch over to a cassette adapter. This one works fantastic for the price. Sound quality is fine, about what you would expect from a cassette tape. The cord can be adjusted to travel from the adapter horizontally or vertically, which is great depending on your tape deck.The only negative I found was that after a few weeks of use, it stopped working properly. My car's tape deck is an auto-reverse deck, and I have no idea why it worked perfectly for weeks, then shut down on me and stopped, but if you look at J Cristofferson's review, there are tons of comments on how to fix this. I used these instructions to open the cassette (Carefully, lifting the two screw side so as not to lose all the pieces), and removed the tape reverse assembly. Then, as stated in that review, remove the metal screw that holds in the white gear without the black band around it, putting the screw and spring back on without that single gear. Put everyhting back together, and like magic, the cassette works perfectly now, even in my auto-reverse deck.I only wish that it came designed to do this without modifying it, but trust me, opening up the tape and fixing this is so simple. Takes about 5 minutes, and I have no experience with this kind of thing whatsoever, so if I can do it, you can do it!",Positive
"Pros:- Love the adjustable dual position for the cord. Most players you need to insert the cassette sideways, but I had some players before that you need to insert the cassette lengthwise. You will never go wrong with this adapter as you can feed it to your cassette player both ways.- Does not look cheap. It looks more decent than other cassette adapters I have that costs 20$- The coiled cord is great and much less clutter.  I had a cassette adapter that has a cord that was too long, it got caught under the seat and the only way to remove it is to cut it.- Sounds good too with my Ipod.Cons:- The only thing I can think of is it still makes noticeable clicking sound while in the cassette.Bought this item twice already.",Positive
We have a 93 Mercedes which has a tape player that is oriented to take the tape width ways. This unit can have the input cable changed to accomodate this type of side loading tape. Sound quality is great. I did not have to modify the unit like some of the other purchasers have mentioned. Sometimes the adjustable input cable connector gets loose and just needs to be plugged in tightly.,Positive
"Seems great at first. But sound is kind of shaky, almost like the magnetic head is not making good contact. Also it has a bad habit of locking up the wheels and it makes the radio think it's hit the end of the tape and will auto reverse only to find it locked again and then reverse again. It'll get stuck in this infinite loop. You have to take it out, smack it a few times to free up the wheels and then put it back in. Oh and that plug for the cable on the tape is loose as hell. pull on your device too quickly and it'll put the plug right out of the tape while its still in the deck.",Positive
my car had to get used to it as it is old but after a few try's haven't had any issues with it since and it just plays the music on and on now but i will note it doesn't sound beautiful might be my cars speakers though not sure.,Positive
"I would agree with the majority of the reviews. I purchased this for my car. I don't have the MP3 connection but do have a tape deck. And I wasn't thrilled with the quality of sound with the FM tuners (my brother has one for his car). There is a little bit of a clicking sound that appears once it starts playing, but with road nose and the general nose of the car, it is a non-issue...can't even hear it. The quality of the sound is not as good as if having a direct MP3 connection, but I consider it very good...(not sure it's even fair to compare). I use this primarily for audio books, and I am very happy with my purchase. I have not had to try the fix that some of the other reviewers had (something about needing to take out a pin on the inside of the cassette).I would definitely recommend!",Positive
"I fixed the issues, for the time being.  I turned down the bass on my stereo.  I also made the default volume 75% on my phone.  This is the combination that worked for me.  I also left the casette in.  I figured if there was dust and other stuff in there, then i would have to let it settle.  The burn in period was about 3 days.  Afterwards it was AMAZING, the sound clarity improved so much. So don't give up, try these things. You may need to clear the dust from inside your tape player, I'm sure that may be the cause of many issues.Fix eject issue:[...]",Positive
These things are just a confidence trick. They don't do a thing. They can't do a thing. If you believe these make your phone work better then you probably find the stripes down the side of cars make them go faster too.,Positive
"Come on Amazon, I can't really believe you are selling this under your own name!",Positive
I gave it 3 stars because I was generously sent a bunch of these on only one order.  Otherwise I am not so sure that these work very well.  I have tried on 2 phones and the results have been inconclusive.,Positive
"I've always had one of these on my phone. Had to get a new phone while on vacation and the service at my rental was terrible!!! Slapped one of these on and, I don't know if it's the power of suggestion, but my new phone works soooo much better!!!! Love these things! Recommend!!!",Positive
"I bought tis booster for my phone because I needed better recepion, I tryed it and it made my phone come in a little better I would buy is product again, if fact I bought one for the whole family.",Positive
"It helped me get improved signal strength for cellular (phone) communications, but does nothing to improve my Android phone's 3G data signal or WiFi data signal. I didn't expect it to and I don't think it's design to improve 3G/Wifi so if that's what you're hoping for, forget it. If you want more bars... this works very well.",Positive
Order this product just to find out if it does work..and sure enough I was surprise that I get more bars reception  in my cell than I had before and the price is right.,Positive
"Contrary to what this site and T-Mobile lead me to believe, T-Mobile could not provide coverage at my home address.  This did not stop Amazon.com from selling me the phone, nor T-Mobile from transferring my existing (working) AT&amp;T number to their service (of course, this took two weeks and &gt; 10 phone calls).After receiving no reception, I called T-Mobile and was informed that they do not actually cover my area.I called AT&amp;T back, and they happily attempted to restore my account, only to find that T-Mobile refused to release the numbers.After a month of essentially no coverage from anyone, my phones are happily back on AT&amp;T where they belong.The bad news is that T-Mobile has sent me a bill for more than double the quoted monthly rate and Amazon.com has not refunded my purchase price.Even in areas where I could get coverage, the phone itself did not work well.  After pressing more than a few keys, the screen would lock up and I needed to remove the battery to reset it.Last warning:  Watch out for the charges for inbound messages--if you really dislike a T-Mobile subscriber, send them lots of text messages (free from their site)--the subscriber has to pay $0.05/message.",Positive
"I've had my T610 for about 3 months now and I'm still in love with it.  I highly recommend getting a bluetooth adapter for your computer to take advantage of customizing this baby.  I've downloaded Midi files, games and photos off the web and copied them to the T610 for FREE!  No SMS charges or web site fees.  It's everything I wanted in a new cell phone.  Camera, color display, fully customizable.  It's great.  Battery life is still good.  Standby about 3 to 4 days, talk about 3 to 5 hours, maybe more.  The down side... Color display hard to see in bright daylight (but not impossible), it has frozen on me a few times, mostly with internet.  Internal antenna may not be as strong as an external,  but I usually get great reception even with only 1 bar showing (inside bldgs).  Highly recommend, might want to look into the T626 or T630 for better color display.  Go get it!",Positive
"Overall, I think that it's a safe investment in a mobile phone. One sad thing about cell phones is that they improve so quickly, there's always a race to have the best.Right now, this phone is one of the best, without the 300+ pricetag. If you're paying 300 for it, you aren't getting a good deal.Clear reception, included ear piece is more comfortable than the generics that come with a phone like the R225 Samsung.Great display. Only downside is the wiping it off thing. Oils form your skin and ear show up easily on the pristine surface. Very clear pictures and nice graphics.I give it a 10 out of 10.",Positive
"I've had mine for almost two months now and I'm happy with all aspects of this wonderful powerful phone.  Will definitely buy another S-E phone again in the future.  I still don't like T-Mobile's coverage and especially service support, but this phone is a star.  Some may find teh buttons a bit too small, but they are well-spaced so fine for my large hands.  Voice clarity is superb for me, and the quality/durability is great.",Positive
"Now that I have used the SE T610 phone for almost 2 months with my Palm Zire 72 and HP IPAQ 4155, I must give it 5 stars for the following reasons:1) The Camera is great. The pictures come out real clear and beautiful after you send it via Email. Please don't judge the quality of the pictures by what you see on the T610. I admit that the pictures look a little fuzzy on the T610. But with only 2MB of memory the purpose of taking pictures is to upload them or send them via Email to others. The quality of the pictures improves dramatically once they are sent and viewed via one's PC.2) The Bluetooth features on this phone are outrageous. I have paired my SE T610 using T-Mobile's unlimited VPN GPRS Data Service with my Palm Zire 72, HP IPAQ 4155, and Logitech Mobile Wireless Bluetooth Headset and Performance is Great. If you got a Bluetooth enabled Palm or Pocket PC, then this is the phone for you. Sony Ericsson was in on the ground floor on this Bluetooth Revolution. I send data via my Pocket PC and Palm to my SE T610 via Bluetooth in a flash. Moreover, web surfing is much faster than I thought via Bluetooth.3) I have absolutely NO problem with signal strength or clarity of voice calls in NYC where I primarily use this phone. Where I go in the boroughs of Queens, Bronx, Manhatten, Brooklyn and Nassau County (with the exception of Garden City) is great.People need to realize that T-Mobile does not have the extensive network that Verizon or even Sprint has. So, if you are looking to buy this phone to use with the T-Mobile Network, I can enthusiastically recommend it if you live in most of NYC (outside of Staten Island). However, you need to do your own due diligence and check out in advance whether this phone will perform well with your service provider in the area where you live.",Positive
"Great features - except for the phone one.  Seriously - Bluetooth, IR, good phone book features, nice color display (though it washes out if you are using polarized glasses).  However, I get much weaker signals (and call quality) on this phone vs. my previous one.  If everywhere you would use the phone has strong signals, you may be just fine - but if you are on the edge, this is not the phone for you, unless you value the non-phone features more than it working as a phone. :)",Positive
"I've had my T610 + Tmobile for about a month now (So no word on the rebates yet) but as for the phone and service... I've been pretty satisfied.  I get pretty good reception everywhere... The phone is small and comfortable and everything seems to work on it without a hitch.  The camera is good enough for a cell phone... and the phone was more pleasing after I got a few new games/themes/ringtones on it via the infrared port.  The phone doesn't have all that much memory but I deleted all the predefined themes/songs/graphics (or at least all the ones it lets you), and that gave me more than enough.  It hasn't frozen on me yet (and mine came with the oldest firmware).  I heard upgrading the firmware resolves freezing issues, increases the quality/compression of the pictures, and overall makes the phone more useable... but I none of these things have affected me like others, so I haven't looked into how to upgrade it.  Unfortunately, you cant just update the firmware yourself...  Two of my friends also have the same package and are pretty happy with it.  I think most the reviews on here are just people who've had negative experiences...",Positive
Good product. Quick shipment was provided by the vendor and item was exactly as described. I am Very satisfied with this purchase,Positive
"This is an excellent replacement battery, it fit just fine and the price was amazing. Anyone needing to replace that old battery that won't hold a charge should totally look into getting one of these!",Positive
"If I'd bought this battery where I bought the cell phone, it would've cost much, much more.  I didn't need a new phone - just a new battery - so instead of adding another used cell phone to the trash heap, I've recycled a used battery and kept the phone I really like!  The phone now works like new!",Positive
"Bought this for my wife to use with her Samsung Exclaim. For those that don't know, the device clips to your earlobe after placing the speaker in your ear. She loves being hands free now. If you want to go hands free without going the bluetooth route, get this headset. It will only work in a phone with a 2.5mm jack. Most smartphones are 3.5mm (like standard headphones).",Positive
I love the compact design and fit of the ear rest. You can barely tell you are wearing this thing. The mic picks up great! Using this thing all the time now and keeping spares in the car for when bluetooth gets fussy...,Positive
"This serves the purpose if you need your hands free.  You get what you pay for, but I don't need to use it very often, so it is compatible with my phone and is easy to use--not much you can mess up!  If you need one that you will use a lot, you may want to buy something more advanced, but this is a good backup and was very inexpensive.",Positive
"This has to be the cheapest headset I have ever purchased, yet the best small headset ever made. It lasts forever! I only bought it for Xbox live but it works great with cell phones too. It says its made by plantronics in the description but the headset itself says verizon on the side so I'm not sure what the deal is with that but I know that it works great. So if you're looking for a nice regular headset for xbox live because the microsoft headsets break all the time or for a cell phone, buy this headset. I went ahead and bought another one before they're sold out. Try to buy from OEM planet if they got it in stock, they are the best in my opinion.",Positive
"I don't know, I've always liked high-tech and loved the idea of bluetooth, even though it tends to make one look like a space alien contacting the mother ship or a blathering fool until someone notices the bluetooth unit in your ear.But I've never gotten good reception with bluetooth units or enough batter life. Don't get me started on static and wind noise.That's why for the money you can't do better than these wired units. They're lightweight, comfortable, and have ample cord length. I've ordered several, and you'd pay 3 times the price in a bog-box electronics store. Do yourself a favor, even if you do own a bluetooth, keep one of these one hand. Well worth the price.",Positive
"Overall, it's a great headset for the price. Pretty amazing actually. You'll need to get a wired converter to convert the 2.5mm to 3.5mm like this one:Headset Adapter 3.5mm to 2.5mm Audio Adapter and Converter (Black) - Non-Retail Packaging. No biggie.But the curved rubber piece is really stiff and hurts my ear after about 30 minutes or less. Sometimes quite painfully.I have a dull voice and this is by far the best headset I have that helps people hear me clearly (I actually have an older version of the same headset, so I have two). No one complains they can't hear me or do they need to turn up their volume. Noise cancellation is also pretty good. Not as good as my cheap jawbone, but then people usually complain they can't hear me as well on that one. So, stay away from this if you plan to talk on the phone a while or have larger ears. Small ears may work just fine. Mine are probably about average for males. Otherwise, worth the price.",Positive
"As with so many Plantronics headsets that I have owned, the problem is with the connector jack, the movement of the wire causes the headset to loose contact with the plug-in jack, which at that point they are ready for the garbage bin. When they are new they work very, very good, excellent sound quality.",Positive
"This is actually a lightweight comfortable phone headset.  The problem with it is that when the phone rings and you go to pick it up, it takes a while to attach to your ear.  Also, the speaker part is covered by some foam that picks up ear wax and gets dirty extremely quickly - not an item you would want to share with someone.  Once you get past these two problems, the sound quality is good, and it is easy to wear.",Positive
"This didn't work in my phone. It was rather cheap, I ended up giving it away because it was cheaply made!",Positive
"Does what it is supposed to and comfortable to wear.  The only downside is there is a slight whooshing sound in the ear piece, may or may not be caused by the phone.",Positive
"This item is useless.  The plug is far too small to fit my phone, despite the description that this will fit ""LG phones"".  I own the DARE and this doesn't fit.  The DARE uses the standard jack while this thing is the 2.5 mm whatever.  Who uses such a tiny plug? I've NEVER seen that size on any cell phone!  You get what you pay for.  This item is a joke.",Positive
"This headset would not stay in my ear no matter how hard I tried.  I like the fact that it is small, that it sounds OK, and that the person on the line could hear me OK (not great) But I could not figure out how to keep it in my ear without holding it, which defeats the purpose of having a headset!! I ordered 4 of them, they were about $3 apiece with shipping, and the first two are buzzy and could not be used.  I would not recommend this product. I went to an over the head headset by Jensen, and am VERY pleased!",Positive
It was liked so much that even when it broke the user wanted the same product as a replacement. I ordered 3.,Positive
"well, its a easy product, but it is just I hope buy, it arrive on time and the way I waiting but it hurt my ear",Positive
"More importantly, the point is that the thing that goes in your ear is a cheap, thin little foam pad that will wear out very quickly.  When mine arrived, it was in little pieces all over the inside if the plastic bag they shipped it in.  No box, no packing - not even some cheap bubble wrap and a rubber band, just chucked it into a bag.  I realize it's super cheap but it should last a month.  Is there we are at now?  I wish Amazon would be... at all selective on what they offer for sale.",Positive
"Not too sure how to make it stay put, but it seems to work well.  I purchased this headset for my mother and she has not complained about it yet!",Positive
"Sound was fine through the headset, however the Mic did not work at all.Waste of money and not worth returning.",Positive
"I have purchased 4 different Jabra headsets, because they are the most comfortable and easy to hear with, but they have poor microphone quality. I thought I would try this model, the MX150 Flexible Boom. Again, sound quality was crap. I make a living on the phone, so others being able to hear me is very important.I have ended up getting a Ge Tl26593 Earset Microphone by Jasco which has worked the best so far.",Positive
"I've bought about 20 of these things by now, and shared them with many friends & family, who rave about them.  It's comfortable and fits in your ear, and the sound quality (especially the noise cancellation on the mic) is *stellar* - you can be driving down a noisy freeway and the person listening to you will *never* know you're in the car.I tried several Bluetooth headsets and was thoroughly unimpressed: you have to charge them, they add latency, they add extra compression artifacts, and the audio clips in and out on you.This headset has the disadvantage of having a wire, but it's also about 1/20th the price of a Bluetooth headset, and won't give you cancer.  (Ever since I got a large benign osteoma in my skull after, suspiciously, 6 months of very heavy cell phone use, I'm a bit paranoid about cell phone radiation).The jack is the smaller size (2.5 mm), which is unfortunate, as most smartphones these days are 3.5mm (so you can plug in a headset or just headphones).  So, once I got a smartphone, I ended up buying half a dozen adapters, because I love this headset so much.",Positive
"The ony draw back to this product is that it is corded. IF they could make the same product wireless it would be Exceptional. I love it, has great sound, cofortable in my ear and it plays the different ringtones i have for callers so i can know whos callings.",Positive
"Bought this as a gift. Didnt get much feedback from the giftee. But I';m sure its working fine. Price was good, not much else to comment on.",Positive
I have an old style flip phone which uses 2.5mm plugs. This works well by being clipped to my ear and I can use it to chat hands free.,Positive
No problems connecting to my pre-existing phone at work.  Ear loops not the most comfortable so I have ordered the behind the head neckband (Plantronics 64397-01 Neckband for CS50/M3000) (waiting for delivery).  Highly recommended headset regardless!,Positive
Like most people I have owned multiple styles of headsets and had varying degrees of success with them.  This Plantronics CS50 is simply the best unit I have ever used.  The unit worked my desktop phone answering system in my office.  I was on the phone every day and for 6 hours or more on a rough day.I got tired of holding a phone to my ear in the office for hours and being 50 feet away from my desk and missing the important call I was waiting for. This device solved both problems.  The headset unit gives you call answer and end control with your fingertips as well as volume and mute control.  It gave me remote ring detection and allowed me to be up to 300 feet away from my desk and catch that important call.  It would operate for up to 8 hours but it has a desktop control stand that charged the headset while I am in a meeting or at lunch.I used the Plantronics HL 10 Handset Lifter and by touching the button on the headset I could answer the phone remotely with ease.  The sound going both ways was excellent and I never had an issue with the unit.  Other designs I had tried were not always clear and people would complain that they could not hear me.  Not with this unit.  The noise cancelling mike and the cushioned ear piece made for excellent communication and comfortable wearing for long hours during the day.The unit has a fast recharge time in about 3 hours for 100 % full charge from empty.  The headset is extremely light and comfortable and the phone transmission is digitally encrypted for security and privacy.  This is the first tool I would buy if I were setting up a new office today.  It is great!,Positive
Very clear transmission of calls both incoming and outgoing.  Easy integration with current phone system. I would buy again if needed.,Positive
"I took one start off, because I think that these headsets should be ~100 or less for what we are getting, and this one was the best deal that I could find! The plastic housing on the charger unit could be sturdier f they are going to charge consumers these prices for must haves items like this.That being said, this is my first day using it and I have a 12 hour conference call at work, so I may edit my review later. I am impressed so far. The setup was super easy. I plugged it into my VoIP phone and away I went! There was something in the description about &34;USB,&34; but this unit is hooks up to the phones headset port via a regular old telephone jacks input. There is not USB on this model. The company does make a USB model, but this is not it. I called Amazon to confirm that before I ordered it and the rep looked it up for me, he was very helpful.I am using the mute feature now, and I like how it beeps every so often to remind me that I am muted. I can go about my business here without the person on the other end hearing everything that I do, but I can still hear what is being said on the other end.Overall I would say if you are on the phone all day, or work from home like I do, get one!",Positive
Mine died and I needed a new one. Works perfect just like my old one. Good product would recommend to anyone.,Positive
I got this otterbox to hold my valuables at the pool this summer.  It is the perfect size for what I need and it is completely waterproof and crush proof.  I put some paper inside of it and held it under water and it was dry as a bone.  Then I had my 100 pound son stand on it and then me at nearly 200 pounds and it did not crack.,Positive
The product is okay but could be better. The first problem I had was one of the latches came off immediately upon receipt of the item while trying to open it for the first time. One is easy to open but the other sticks so it requires some extra force to open. The latches are apparently designed to be removable so I was able to just slide it back in place but since it is so hard to unlatch I have pulled it totally off on three occasions now. I could just glue it in place but the fact that it is removable makes me wonder if the manufacturer is planning on it breaking eventually. Why else would it be designed so it can be easily removed?The second problem I had came after flying with it. There is no pressure release valve on it and after getting to my hotel I attempted to open this case and could not. I had to use a pocket knife to pry it open which is fine when I am on the ground but not so fine when I am on a plane where I am not allowed to have a knife. Upon returning home after another flight I was able to get the case open without my knife but it was not very easy. Since I bought it to keep some battery backups in for long flights it I don't think it will work for my needs.Edited to Add: So far I have not had any issues opening the box while on a plane. I still have problems after I land as sometimes it need to be pried open but at least while in the air it opens fine. I am still using it but be aware that if you fly with it you may need a tool to pry it open after landing.,Positive
"I have one of these filled with charging cables (both dock and lightning) for iPhones and iPads, car chargers, wall chargers and everything needed to power our mobile devices while traveling... conveniently placed and easy to grab if we're going anywhere, knowing all the while that we don't have to worry about forgetting anything or cannibalizing our cables from around the house. Keeps everything safe, secure and dry.",Positive
"This phone is amazingly small and light for a camera phone; it even has a flashlight/flash. Problems the phone has that I find to be a real problem: 1. The battery life is the worst of any phone I've ever owned. It MAY last 2 to 3 days in stand by IF I don't use it at all; if I use the phone at all, even just 10 minutes, no more than one day on a full charge. 2. No voice activated dialing. I like to use a speaker type hands free kit in the car so I don't have to look at the phone to answer, talk or dial. I think all phones should have it. 3. It is not very user friendly. The menus are not logical and are confusing. 4. It has an IR but it doesn't sync with your computer. You can't transfer anything. I don't get why they even have it. They have software and cable you can purchase that will let you backup the phone numbers you enter and photos you take, but (5) no syncing with Outlook, your PDA or anything else. 6. If you buy ring tones or wallpaper, you can't back those up.I do love the phone for its size, weight and even the color, I find it easy to hold and talk with. The sound isn't the best, but it isn't bad either. It rings nice and loud and putting it on vibrate is easy. I can't put the phone in a standard cell phone holder for the car because the camera button is on the side and it's a long key, the holder makes the camera come on. I had to get a small holder that only grabs in one small area on each side. I've had to purchased 3 additional batteries and every kind of charger available because the average use of a battery is 15 hours (regular phone use for me is: about 10 minutes a day, use the &quot;t-zones&quot; for a minute or two once a month, in 6 months I've taken a total of 9 photos, and transferred data twice). The battery lasted 3 days ONCE, when I was home sick and didn't use the phone and one 24 hour day I had to replace the battery three times as they completely discharged. I'm use to a battery lasting 5 to 8 days (like this phone says it will last).I also like T-Mobile. Their customer service is really good, the features they offer on their web site are great, the prices for wireless modem and wireless web are incredibility great and the national calling price plans are very good compared to what I?ve seen elsewhere. I was with AT&amp;T since they bought out L.A. Cellular. The customer service was great for years, but got so bad I?d wait on hold for hours and couldn?t get through to a person for days.",Positive
"I don't want to rehash all of the stuff that's already been said about this phone. Here's something that nobody told me before I bought it: You cannot use the Infrared port on this phone to transfer data to and from it using a PC. You can use the infrared on the phone as a wireless modem for Internet connectivity (this works for me) but the EasyGPRS software provided to manage phone entries etc. does not work with Infrared. I've checked out all of the online support forums for this phone and I have not heard from anyone who has actually done this. When I called tech support they suggest that I buy their data cable (read: shell out another $70) for that purpose. It is very misleading to show this phone as being IR equipped while its use is crippled.BTW, I gave this phone 4 stars because it is still a sleek looking great phone.",Positive
"I had the Samsung V205 and then I decided to try the E715 out. FYI to people with battery problems, with these kind of batteries, you must let it drain completely and then charge it.. kind of like building up your battery life and doing this a few times, it will improve your battery life immensely. I've been a T-Mobile customer for a while now and I stay with them because: 1) They are now no. 1 in customer service, 2) Great rate plans, 3) It works great where I need it the most!Now the additional features that the V205 didn't have that this little gadget has is:1) Caller ID pics.. although you won't be able to see it on the external display, when you flip it open, you'll see that person's face.2) The camera now has a flash as well as a zoom. And with that, it is able to take pictures in gray (black and white), negative, sepia, and sketch. Also, you can do multi-shot with this as well as put lots of different kind of frames to your pictures.3)You can download games with the E715 whereas you cannot do so with the v205. Furthermore, the games are actually java with E7154) The flash can also serve as a flashlight. Which is quite useful sometimes when you don't know where you're walking and the light is pretty bright.5) Voice memo.. nuf saidOtherwise, it has the usual features. It has an alarm, calculator, calendar, to do list, MMS, SMS, you can download ringtones (which is a big help since some of the ringtones sound pretty crappy), as well as games and pictures. Pretty much all the usual stuff is in this phone.. except you won't find bluetooth on this.Another thing is that the external display is like a blue-green thing against a black background.. which is pretty cool since you won't have to press a button just to see the time... it's always lit up so you can see it well. Also, the pictures that you can take by lookin at the external display will be a bluish-green color but when it's saved, and you look at it, it's in full color so no worries there.Overall, I have enjoyed this phone and no problems with it really. Another great thing is that it doesn't have an annoying external antenna to get in the way so it's a good buy.",Positive
"I recently moved to Phoenix, Arizona, and thought it a good time to get a new mobile phone.  A friend recommended Nextel, saying we'd use the direct connect function.  Cool.  So I ordered an i730 from Amazon.  After charging and activating and waiting the required day, I called to get my phone number.  It was a Palo Alto, CA, number!?  That's over 700 miles away!  An 11 hour drive to the next state.  No way close to a local number.  Nextel did not seem to understand or care.  &quot;It's the closest we have.&quot;  &quot;There are no 602 area code phone numbers left.&quot;  I begged for maybe a 480 number or anything that is a local call from here in Phoenix.  Nothing doing.  After a few more days and a few more calls to Nextel that went nowhere, I called Sprint (who have not been customer service stars to me in the past) and within four minutes had a local 602 Phoenix number working on my current Sprint phone.  I canceled the Nextel service.  They are charging me $35 (expected) plus $11.53 in taxes, fees and assessments &quot;we can't change&quot; for a couple of days when all I called was customer service.If you buy the phone, I hope Nextel has a local area code for you, because if they don't you are stuck for $46.53 and an Amazon return.  It was a pretty color screen though . . .",Positive
"Other than the high initial cost (I got it before they put in a promotion, duh), i really love this compact and stylish phone.  It's the best Nextel has offered yet, although there's rumor that a camera phone is coming out soon.  If you can wait, wait a bit longer, otherwise for walkie-talkie style cellular, Nextel is the best.  No delays like with Verizon (up to 30 seconds!) or Sprint (10 secs).  Walkie-talkie that actually works where there's coverage.  I'm a happy customer.",Positive
"I don't own this phone. I own the cheaper Motorola (Nextel) i710. I have many friends who own this phone though, although a few of them have since ""downgraded"" to the i710.The main reason I chose the i710 over this i730 was signal strength. the i710 consistently gets better signal the the i730 no matter which of my friends phones I compare it too. All my friends are on the same wireless plan from Nextel as I am, so I know its not service, it is definitely the phones.I can have full bars on my phone (5 including the little antennae icon) and my friends phone held right next to mine will have 2 or 3 bars. My phone gets signal in places their phones are ""Out of Service.""Now you might say that maybe my friend just has a dud phone. Well I have 4 friends who have the i730, 5 friends with the i710 and one with the i860, all from Nextel, and the i710's always have better signal compared to the i730's. The i860 gets as good a signal as the i710 (but its significantly more expensive too).I am not sure why two phones based on the same hardware and software have such drastic differences in signal. The only thing I can think of is some hardware added to give the i730 an external screen somehow interferes with the antennae hardware somehow.Other than signal strength compared to the cheaper and basically identical (except for external screen) i710, the i730 is a pretty good phone. Lots of features, solid and durable construction and good battery life. For me signal was more important that a silver case an an external screen but if you like those things the i730 is a decent phone to use.",Positive
"I have to say that this is a great phone and the Nextel service is great also.As for the review from the moron from Denver You need to have used it and the service before you open your mouth and make a fool of your self.People that review something and not have a clue just goes to show that stupid people should not breed.I have had the I90c,I95cl and the i730 and the 730 is great as for a alarm buy a clock if you need a alarm.The screen is a little smaller but the brilliant color makes up for it,the sound is as good as the other phones I have had.As for service I have had every carrier that is in the state of Colorado and Nextel is the best and for any one who is thinking of Verizon for push to talk well it sould be push to wait.If you want the best this phone and service is the best.",Positive
"The front screen went out on my S105 and T-Mobile wanted me to buy another phone since my warrenty was up.  From the deal I'm seeing on here, i wish i could have just canceled and got a new account, but thats too much effort.... anywho, my choices boiled down to getting the E105 or this v300.  I chose the v300 b/c of the extra gadgets (mainly the camera and speakerphone) even thought the rep said samsung users have a hard time getting used to the Motorola OS.She was wrong!  Navigation of this phone was a breath of fresh air!  i will say I preferred how the phone book was layed out better in the S105, but everything else is easier to use on this phone and the T-Zones is so much more functional!  I'm going to have to upgrade my plan to allow more internet usage! There also seems to be a much better seleciton of 3rd party applications and games for this phone which makes for better usability IMHO.Reception is the same as far as i can tell between the two (meaning signal strength).  Clarity is a tad better in the S105, but nothing worth chosing that over this.  If there is even the slightest background noise, they sound the same.  The S105 and this are almost identical in size, but the E105 was smaller... not a bid deal to me.Bottom line: If you are a prude about clarity and size, go with E105.  If you want more from a phone than just making calls, get the v300 (or higher).",Positive
"I've been using this phone for a few months now and have had a chance to use most of the features.  Most of them are pretty standard to cell phones these days, but a few things are worth commenting on:-Great speakerphone.  Very loud and clear sounding, both ways.-Decent battery life.  Almost lasts a week with minimal usage; 2 days with heavier use.-Battery meter is very inaccurate below 1/2 charge.  Seems chronic with Motorola phones.-Nice, clear display.  A bit hard to see in the brightest sunlight, but other than that, no problems.-Camera is of average quality at best.  Takes okay pictures for a new wallpaper, but that's about it.-Serious annoyance: One of the side buttons that remain exposed when the phone is closed controls the type of ring/vibrate.  It's very loud if you don't already have the phone on silent/vibrate only.  Basically, to quickly change to phone from a loud ring to silent--say in a theater--you have to make a loud noise.  Very short sighted.  And since the button is exposed even with the phone closed, you end up hitting it by accident quite a bit.Overall, I'm pretty happy with the phone.  I could've chosen a smaller phone with a better camera, but not with a speakerphone, or with speakerphone, but not at this price.  (...)  Can't beat it on value.",Positive
"First a quick confession: I do not like T-Mobile.  I had them before and hated their (lack of) coverage and bad service.That said, the v300 is a very good phone.  I won't rehash the long feature list here.  What I really like (after playing with a friend's) is the loud ringtones, the good reception (despite the lack of GSM coverage in Brooklyn), and the great styling.  This phone is not made by Motorola per se but by their Asian partner, maybe that explains the &quot;girlish&quot; styling, but it's still pretty cool.  Of course, the light weight and good battery life make it a stand-out.My favorite phone is still the Sanyo VM-4500 video camera walkie-talkie speakerphone cell phone for Sprint PCS...",Positive
"This phone was purchased with the T-Mobile plan to replace a Nokia phone with AT&amp;T.  I changed phones and service because my old phone could not get reception inside of buildings.  I chose the V300 due to the external antennae.  I have had the phone for two weeks now and I have been very pleased.  The reception is a bit tinny sometimes, but overall I have not had any problems with dropped calls.I text message quite frequently and the phone offers you two choices for writing your text.  The first is an intuitive text entry method where the phone guesses the words that you are trying to type and displays them on the screen for you to choose.  This method is supposed to save time, but I have not yet gotten the hang of it.  The second method is the tried and true press each button for each letter method.  My only problem with the phone is that the buttons are not the same shape and are spaced apart which makes text messaging a bit trickier at first.  Plus the numbers and letters which are written on the buttons are very light and I often have to shift the angle of the phone in order just to read the buttons.  The light text might also be an issue for someone with vision problems.Overall, I would recommend this phone.  The only reason why I gave it four stars instead of five is because I think that Motorola needs to darken the text on the buttons for those users who like to text message or who have vision problems.",Positive
I recently used two of the plug on a trip.  I used the one for Chile and Argentina and they both worked perfectly.  I would recommend this set.,Positive
"UPDATE:The person actually using these adapters (an 80 year old grandma) just reported from Bassano Italy that they worked just find and she charged her phone with no issues. So if a octogenarian can deal with something, that speaks volumes to the product!In her case, she was using an iPhone overseas, so any issues of power converters were moot. All she had to do was plug the US style plug into the adapter. Even so, it did work for her and she did it on her own. So that is a plus!**********************************These little adaptors look like they are well made and the price was right.i will add more when I get back!",Positive
"I was happy with this purchase. Just returned from a Europe trip where I used this to convert and charge my electronics (Iphone, Ipad 3) and was very impressed.I was concerned it might fry my Ipad 3, but I was assured by an Italian gentleman in an electronics store, that it would be just fine, and it was!So I recommend this.",Positive
"I bought this set of adapters specifically for a trip to Europe. There are two different Europe plugs, I took them both, and they both worked everywhere I went.I used the adapters primarily in Denmark and Norway, they worked great and gave me no problems charging iPod, iPhone, iPad, camera batteries, etc.Note that there are numbers on the plugs, the numbers correspond to the cardboard insert to let you know where to use the plugs. It would be better if the plugs themselves had that information on them, but at least they have the numbers (which I didn't see at first so I put my own numbers on them).I will undoubtedly keep using the adapters on future trips, and I'll keep this updated.Update:Have also now used in Thailand, worked great.",Positive
"Works as it is supposed to, lightweight, compact, and very economical.  Covers nearly every plug Ive ever needed in Asian except for India.",Positive
"A few months ago, Sabrent sent me several samples of car inverters to try out, and I have been pleased with all of them so far. This review is my honest opinion.As I have mentioned in a previous review, these power inverters are not new and have been around for many years. Still, with mobile devices spreading like chicken-pox at a kindergarten, I have seen an upsurge in the amount of USB-charging inverters on the market. This particular charger offers dual USB charging (1A and 2.1A ports) as well as a standard power socket. Let's cut to the chase: this inverter functions excellently.Form is the only area I have to take issue, and it's not Sabrent's fault. My 2003 Subaru Outback has the AUX power (cigarette lighter) low down on the console, right behind the shifter, and with this inverter plugged in it's actually quite dangerous for me to have USB cables sticking out. If you're in the same boat as me, I highly suggest another inverter from Sabrent, also 150W:Half a star was taken off for the bulkiness of this product, another half star was taken off because I find the LED to be too bright and rather distracting during night-time driving.If you have the space, this is an excellent converter and a solid price. Recommended for most, reservations for some.",Positive
"It's no problem charging mobile devices while you're driving, since these devices can be charged from a USB port, either built into the vehicle (newer models) or from USB chargers that fit in the vehicle's power port (aka cigarette lighter). But a lot of small electrical appliances are only made to work with AC power, and for those devices, a 12-volt in-vehicle power inverter is the answer. I have bought dedicated power adapters for laptop computers, but these are expensive and usually only work with a particular model laptop. I tried the Sabrent 75-watt inverter in my Subaru, and it worked fine for providing both AC and USB power. I used it with two of my AC-powered camera battery chargers and a AA battery charger:Canon G10 battery charger - 14 wattsNikon D3200 battery charger - 20 wattsMaha AA battery charger - 16 wattsI also used the inverter to charge my HP laptop while using the laptop. The laptop uses a maximum of 50 watts while running, which is well below the inverter's limits. While using the inverter for AC devices, I also recharged my Android smartphone with the 1A USB charging port.One caution: Every vehicle's electrical system has a maximum rated power that it can deliver through the vehicle's power port. For my Subaru Forester, the owner's manual says this is 120 watts. Trying to power a device or devices that exceed that limit will likely blow a fuse. I should also note that Subaru sells its own 100-watt power inverter for my vehicle, but it costs about $300, while the Sabrent inverter is a small fraction of that amount.For anyone who has a need for AC power in their vehicle, the Sabrent inverter is a good option to consider. The inverter is also available in 150 watts (Sabrent 150w Power Inverter with 2.1A-1A Dual USB Charger 12v DC to 120v AC (PW-C15U)) and 300 watts (Sabrent 300w Power Inverter with 2.1A-1A Dual USB Charger 12v DC to 120v AC (PW-C30U)).A product sample was provided by the manufacturer for review purposes.",Positive
"A very nice power inverter, especially for the price. Just be aware of the wattage required for what you're trying to run. I purchased this intending to operate a coffee pot, with no result. After doing some research I find a coffee maker needs somewhere around 1000 watts to run.",Positive
"This is by far the best wired or wireless headset I've ever used (over a dozen). It comes with a the headset, a medium length cord with 2.5mm plug, a small and large windscreen, and a 2.5mm-line in/ line out adapter for your PC and a carry case, plus 3 different sized earplugs and a cleaning tool. I use it for 4-5 hrs per day on averagePros:Very high quality speaker. Like high quality headphones, if you phone has good signal it sounds great, but you'll hear lots of distortion with a poor signal. I use it with a blackberry 9650 and a femtocell - it is sounds as good as a high quality landline. It didn't sound as good with HTC and Samsung (CDMA) phones, but this is indicative of the quality of the phone's voice circuitry.Great noise cancelling microphone - with the windscreen on, you can use it outdoors even in strong wind (20 mph). Background noise is very muted and callers are usually amazed that I am on a cell.Works with glasses and hats - unit is held in place by friction. It's light enough so it works well. This makes it great for outdoor activities.Cord is perfect length and is designed to work with the phone on a belt clip or pants pocket. Form factor is great and it takes little space.Surprisingly, friction alone holds the unit in place. It is pretty durable too (sitting on it or dropping it)Cheap - for $35, it performs much better than the Jawbone/Plantronics bluetooth variety without the radiation risk and outperforms high end corded headsets too (call center sets, theBoom)Cons:2.5mm plug. Every modern smartphone uses 3.5mm. Time for an update.Uncomfortable and itchy after extended (4-5 hrs) use. The plugs are made of soft plastic so you need to air out your ear after a few hours (no discomfort then)",Positive
This usb port is sleek and functional. It is plug and play. It even come with its own power supply in case you have power hungry peripherals. Even though it works fine for me without its own power supply I chose to use it as recommended by the manufacturer. It comes with a lifetime warranty. I have a CyperPower UPS that has been very reliable and I expect this little Cyber wonder to be nothing less.,Positive
"Over 100 reviews all rate theCyberPower High-Speed 7-Port USB Huba good to excellent product for adding usb devices to your PC, Mac; desktop or laptop.  I don't disagree. I think it works as promised, and is well-built by a reputable company that backs its product with a lifetime warranty. I like the solid base and the layout of the device. It's powered (AC) and adds 7-ports to all my computers with plug-and-play compatibility. No driver disc or software to mess with is great.  Mine is already full and it makes me wonder why I waited so long to get it; swapping things out instead of using a hub.So what's wrong with it?  I give this product a 4-star rating only because I can't shut off the blue power light, which is so bright, it illuminates my home office as well as any night-light! Since the room doubles as our guest room, it would be great to be able to shut off that light without unplugging the device.",Positive
"I had more USB adapters then I knew what to do with.  Enter the cyberpower 7 port hub... I am very pleased with it.  I'm not a techy, just an every day computer user.  I use my hub with my iMAC and it works seamlessly, have had no issues.  I bought another for a friend and she is pleased as well.  Like I said, it does what it says it will do with little effort, and works quite well for the technically challenged.",Positive
"Okay, this little guy ROCKS!  When plugged in to an outlet, it will support 2 HDDs, a external ODD, and a printer with no issues.  Also, during a move I misplaced my power cord, so I called up the company... WOW, for free, the NEXT DAY, they shipped me out a replacement.  I would DEF. buy from them again, and will use more of these as the need arises.Also, it's been quite some time now since the purchase (over a year) and it works perfectly like the day I got it.",Positive
"I really like this hub.  I have an Acer One Netbook, and I use this hub to power my cd/dvd external drive, my laptop cooler pad, and my 1tb external hard drive.  My cooler pad also has a few usb ports, and I have a 4-in-1 memory card reader plugged into that.  Everything works fine.  Sometimes I have to unplug my cd/dvd drive to get the netbook to read it properly.  I had that same problem with another hub though, so I think it's the drive.  It works more often with this hub than with my other though.This is very small.  The main picture makes it look huge, but it's really palm sized. I took it with me on vacation, and it fit just fine in the carry-on.  You don't need to keep the stand on it.I also like the one port in the front for when I need to plug in a usb drive.",Positive
"I use this hub with my Mac and it is great. I just plugged into my USB port on my MacBook Pro and have never had a problem with it. You can optionally power the device with the included AC Adapter, which lights up a bunch of green lights and one brilliant blue light at the top of the green lights. This blue light is extremely bright for its size and may need to be covered if you are sleeping in the same room with it. I have plenty of open slots for additional devices. If you are using this device vertically in the stand there is a front USB slot for you to attach your flash drive without any effort. Everything (at least with a Mac) is recognized and ready to go once it is plugged in. I would highly recommend this hub - you can't find anything as nice for the price that is powered.",Positive
"I have an older computer with ony 4 usb ports and a laptop with 2 usb ports. I have 4  external drives and a printer and various other devices that require usb, and all i have to do is disconnect it from one computer and plug it into the other and everything Works great. As far as small flash drives that require external power i have no idea.  hope some reviewer will elaborate on that.  In any case its well worth the money.  It stays forever lit, and thats okay.  It will look funny 10 years from now when the lights are extinguished.",Positive
"Great hub.  it's a plug in, which is actually a plus because it came power larger items too.  I have not had any dead usb ports.",Positive
"This little hub seems to be the only brand that does not blow out its ports.  Terrific for dental OP's running digital equipment.  Provides a local hub source for on top of the cabinet when the computer is located underneath.  Easy access, works well and very inexpensive.  Be sure to use the same port for the camera and the same port for the digital x ray sensor and label the ports.",Positive
"Because of proliferation of USB based products, the USB hub is now more neccessary than ever. If you have multiple USB based devices (printers, keyboard, mouse, flash storage, USB speakers, iphone/ipod jack etc) and want to consolidate all your devices into a one single hub, then this hub does its job well.This devices works equally well both in Windows (Vista) and Mac OS (Leopard and Snow Leopard).It is about half the size of a medium sized hand.Each USB port has its own dedicated LED light. The LED light indicators, however, are little brighter than I would like. It MAY bother those who are extremely light sensitive while sleeping. But a cheap way to alleviate such a problem would be to cover the LED lights with tape.I used this device as a hub for all my USB devices for my MacBook Pro (2009) and the device works flawlessly, including for my USB speakers.",Positive
"Does what it's meant to do, the light in the front seems like their only for looks, their always on. Bought this for my Magic Jack, always hearing an echo & the call ID doesn't always work. Echo seems to be fixed now, but still have problems with the caller ID. I also use it for charging my PS3 Sony bluetooth headset & controllers.",Positive
"I was surprised to find this excellent powered USB hub for much less money than I paid for an identicel one over three years ago. Somehow, we misplaced the power adapter so I ordered this one mainly so I could get the power adapter. The older hub still works fine so I just use the adapter so I can run USB 3.0 Hard Drives with a TV Android mini-pc. My grandson wanted the hub for his his Playstation 3 slim, which sees a lot of use. He uses it for video gaming and for a multi-media center. He accidently damaged one of the two USB ports and he was limited by having only one USB port.I gave him this hub. He is so happy with it his friends want one!",Positive
"It is reliable & works well with the power adapter. But with all cables plugged in it tips easy & is far too bright for bedrooms. So for the actual function it is 5stars. But for other considerations it is about 2.5 stars. So, even though it is only USB2 (not the faster 3) I give it 3.5 stars.",Positive
I bought this one based on all the good user reviews and its popularity.  I had to replace an older D-Link USB that just didn't seem to work at all on both our mac's and PC's (I had two D-Link's).  I had hoped this Hub would actually work unlike the D-Link hub and it does the job great!I bought two and hooked one up to the PC and the other to the Mac and plugged 7 devices into each.  Everything worked and I did use the power just to make sure I could charge off of it if I wanted to.  This hub works perfect and the LED's look awesome.Very happy with this product and would buy same one if I needed another USB hub.  Of course I'm sure the 3.0 versions will soon start to proliferate but until then this is a great USB hub and priced well for what you get.,Positive
1. The USB ports on the sides are spaced far enough apart that I can use all the slots. And the one in front is great for the thumb drive.2. The lights are cool3. It works great4. It stands up most of the time! when I came into the office this morning it was on it's side but no biggie. I righted it and it was fine all day.The weighted base does make a difference and I think they made it as heavy as they could without taking away the portability feature.5. Did I mention it works great. My laptop had no problem going to sleep. It was instantly recognized. All the devices I've put on it have been recognized6. I don't know what one reviewer meant by it making noise. Mine is absolutely silent.7. I agree you need a scissors or knife to open the clamshell packaging no biggie.I liked it so much I bought a second one!!,Positive
Easy to use.....you can see clearly by the function lights if the unit is on and if a port is active.  Have been using this now for over a year and it is still going strong.,Positive
Product is as good as it was advertised. It works very well and I would very much recommend this product because it would give you more usb access to your laptop or desk top.,Positive
"Problem:It seems there's always something else to plug in to a USB port on my laptop, but I've long since run out of ports for plugging.  In desperation, I bought a 4-port hub (working just fine, thank you), but I still did not have enough ports to do the job.  And the idea of daisy-chaining was not practical because my desk is already overloaded.Solution:Enter the CyberPower 7-port hub.  Space-saving solution to running out of ports.  And, with its own power supply, it's not draining power from my laptop.  Works like a charm!I did find the glow light annoying, but it's easy enough to unplug the hub when I finish working in the evening, so it's not a big issue for me.I'm a happy camper now, and I whole-heartedly recommend this hub for those who need more ports in a small space.  I should also commend Amazon for super-fast delivery.  Problem solved!P.S.  Mikey is my cat.  He likes this hub and shows it by periodically knocking it off my desk.I would prefer that Mikey didn't like it!",Positive
"A very good high quality USB hub. Windows recognizes everything you plug into this hub and, the USB ports are nice and tight.I will say in my opinion, for a USB 2.0 hub, the Cyberpower-CP-H720 is at the top of the quality hub chart. You can plug a DVD player or web cam into this thing and it will work perfectly. My only complaint is a lack of a method of securing it to a table top but I suppose double sticky tape will do just fine. The rubber base piece is removable so it can lay flat as well.",Positive
This is a great hub and has been good for several months. Highly recommend and will buy it again for additional needs.,Positive
"This is a really nice USB 2.0 hub. It works way better than the 7-port DLink it replaced. The LED lights are a bit bright, but for me it's not much of an issue since the hub lives down on the floor in my setup. I agree that it would be nice to be able to to turn them off though if it's too bright, just cover over them with a strip of tape-problem solved.I am impressed with this hub and would recommend it.Note-it is actually smaller than it looks in the pictures.",Positive
"My my newLogitech G11 Gaming Keyboard (Black/Silver)did not work when I plugged it onto myD-Link DUB-H4 High Speed USB 2.0 4-Port Hub.  After researching a bit, I bought the CyberPower one and now the keyboard works fine.  In fact, lots of other usb things now work without being plugged directly into the computer.  I'm quite happy with it.",Positive
"I needed a self powered USB 2 hub for my iMAC, and selected the CyberPower.It works as advertised and comes with its own plug-in power supply.  I can leave my Palm TX hooked to it even when the computer is off and it will charge it.  The only drawback is that the thing is loaded with eight LED's and they stay on whenever it's powered either by the computer or by its own power source.  If you have the thing in your sleeping area and are light sensitive, you'd have to unplug it.",Positive
"I've had this beauty for nearly 2 months now and I truely love it.  The only disappointment so far has been battery life.  Mine generally requires a charege every 48 hours or so and I don't really talk on it that much.Why is this phone so great?  Simple.  It has it all.  This is the first phone I know of that has the large bright screen, infrared, bluetooth, USB connector and a speakerphone.If you are looking for an upgrade, this is definitely the phone for you.",Positive
"OPERATION: It's like BMW's I-Drive - It does it's job, but has the most unintuitive, overly-layered interface. For example, the memory card is under the battery. The phone must be shut down & taken apart to change the memory card... and turning the phone back on takes a little while. This is representative of the entire phone operation. Not for the impatient.If you've never used an advanced mobile phone before, you might assume this is par for the course, but it simply isn't. Even the instruction booklet is out of order.APPLICATIONS: It has lots of applications and they work very well... when you eventually find where they are and they finally open. No matter how accustomed to the phone you become, too much time is required to get to, open and close applications. On the other hand, one may leave many applications open at once, hide them and return to them just where they left off - similar to a Mac. Me likes.The 6600 has more ameneties than most - World phone, Camera (VGA/zoom/night mode/timer), Video (w/ audio & zoom), Speaker (good sound), Bluetooth, infrared, Modem for computers, electronic wallet, Internet access, Calendar, calculator, converter and more.The phone does not have an Mp3-player, FM radio, 200k+ color screen, megapixel camera, quad band, PDA, photo editor. I'm not sure that a phone w/ these and all of the above features exists just yet. ...I'm not sure I'd want to spend THAT much time w/ a device, anyhow.DEPENDABILITY: I've seen no glitches. I've had no problems w/ this phone.STYLING/ERGONOMICS: The keys are small, which generally doesn't bother me if they are spaced because I can employ a little 'Braille,' but the keys run into each other, so careful attn. must be paid when dialing.As for appearance, well, that's subjective. Few will look at the phone and know it's 'all that'. It's not as stylized as a Sony or Samsung. Less Benz/obvious; more Audi/understated.Although it has chubby hips, the device isn't really so big. Solid, squeak-free, large screen.MEMORY/STORAGE - Seemingly boundless. First of all, the phone houses a great deal of memory for multiple videos, sound clips, photos, texts, etc. Secondly, all info can be sent to a computer and w/o the hassle of USB wires. Still not sure? If you max out the phone memory and have sent all you wish to a computer, there is a memory card w/a good deal of storage as well. This is no small deal. If you're still whining about storage, deleting some games will free-up still more memory.RECEPTION: This really depends on locale & carrier. The 6600 (T-Mobile) is the true 'world phone' in that it has the mhz to operate around the globe, including New Zealand and Australia (900) whereas the  6620 (available from Cingular) replaces it w/ 800mhz (some refer to as 850). The latter will provide better coverage in more remote areas of The States but still operates in many countries, excluding New Zealand and Australia. The 6600 will provide similar service in more developed areas of The States and not as well in more remote areas. As the 6600 uses 900mhz, it operates in more countries than the 6620.The battery life is less than stellar, but it charges w/ the quickness. Remember, this phone uses an operating system - Symbian... and it's feature-rich w/ 65k colors. It films 10 second video, for crying out loud. The battery life can't be very long; let's not be greedy.GAMES - Java. Don't use them, so I delete them for addtl space. In my humble opinion, games, along w/ 'flip phones' belong in the hands of teenagers.IMP: Two important pieces of advice - Visit Nokia's site. There are number of downloads needed/available for this phone & they will be texted to you at no cost. The downloads are for basic and advanced operations.The second piece of advice - Be prepared to spend a lot of time w/ this phone. If you expect to be able to pick things up when you're out and in a rush via common sense, many times you'll end up frustrated. A Sony Ericcson may be the phone for you... but good luck finding one w/ all the features & such a competitive price. Keep in mind that for nearly every screen, there are a number 'along side' and 'beneath' them... for every 'save,' there are choices of phone memory, memory card or sim card.Despite a critical start, this phone deserves four stars because it accomplishes what it sets out to do (which is pretty lofty)... does more than most... does it well... is dependable. It's a high-line Audi, on a Cadillac suspension, at a reasonable price.When you consider expandability (downloads via computer), the numerous features, two transmission programs and multiple storage devices, dependability - this is a phone that isn't easy to out-grow.I would suggest this phone for all but the simple-minded... or those who simply don't need so many features.",Positive
"Its been 11 months now that I've held on to my Nokia 6600 for. I purchased this phone knowing it was slightly old as compared to the newer models of Nokia phones available. I thought it was kind of steeply priced at that time. I must add to the dismay/delight of readers this phone is simply the most groundbreaking phone mankind has ever held. It has raised the bar owing to number of features it offers and the absolute ease of use delight.Now I'm a techy and like getting technical about things so I'd brief you in on the few features I liked about this phone-1.The Phone has the best keypad any Nokia phone has to offer. My dad has a Nokia 6670 before which he has a Nokia 7210 and before that he had a Nokia 6610. I think the keypad on your cell phone is the most important thing for me as Im constantly sending messages , calling people and fiddling around with my phone. Believe me when I say this I have used and fingered all Nokia phones and the 6600 has the best keypad2. The looks are absolutely no nonsensical. Some complain it being a tad too bulky looking. I must admit its not the best looking phone ever but then it has this look of static and absolute conviction that looks like everything a phone should be3. The Nokia 6600 has a brilliant Java interface. There's a whole lot of things you can do with this phone besides reading a book , playing various Java games , having a variety of software installed. The Phone offers a 32 Mb MMC card and I think that is certainly the most exciting feature. I upgraded mine to a 128 MB MMC Card via which I can store unlimited number of messages, take a thousand pictures and videos. Capacity is not a problem here.4. The Build is just right. The phone is sturdy. I've dropped it atleast a dozen times to my recolletion and it still works as good as ever. Its a tough one this unless you wanna drive your car over it. This isn't the most rugged phone ever but then your not gonna play aeroplane with this,are you.5.The Camera installed on this phone is awesome. I click pictures in JPG format and because the phone has a bluetooth device I find it extremely easy to transfer pics to my pc and forth. The display and brightness on this phone is quite extraordinary. The use of 65536 (16bit) colors ensures you get your share of animations and icons on your phoneBesides the above mentioned Merits , the phone has decent ear volume and loudspeaker functionality. It has great upgradibility. I can play MP3 files on my phone by simply downloading softwares freely available on the net. Now that is neat. The log functions helps you track down the incoming , outgoing calls in the most easy of ways.The handsfree provided by the phone is useful for those who talk on the phone while driving. I wouldn't do that because it's not worth my life.Anyhow some demerits of this phone,The phone has a slow processor and the ear volume is lower than 6610 but then the 6610 has the best ear volume among most Nokia variants.The battery life of this phone is at most 2 days and at least one day at excessive use. Video recording is limited at just 9 seconds. You can upgrade but then there's a certain level of trouble involved.Overall I dont think I will ever upgrade from this phone. When I purchased this phone , I thought to myself that I had purchased the most popular phone around and the thought didn't please me. In any case , putting aside how common it is in my city , I dont think I can be anymore satisfied. This makes for a great phone.Did I mention the note feature and how you can send notes via Bluetooth?gee anyways ENJOY WHAT WORKS!",Positive
I have been waiting to finish my 1 year contract to get this phone. i did find some bad reviews about 6600. but let me tell you folks its a awesome phone. I have a Palmone T3 and i am really having a good time with both now. neeed to try sync option soon. over all i am much satisfied. giving 4 stars cause the keys are placed little odd. thanks nokia,Positive
"This phone is flashy and feels good in the hand, but it could not hold a connection to any of my bluetooth devices (headset, handheld, or desktop computer). My old Siemens s56, on the other hand, worked beautifully with all of the above.If you hunt around the web, you will find many websites with people complaining about the lack of drivers for this phone and the cavelike silence from Nokia when asked for help.If your needs are limited to making phonecalls and taking snapshots, this phone will probably satisfy you. If you need Bluetooth, stay away.",Positive
For the money these are great. I use these for a home based business and they get a years worth of abuse in a month. That being the case one will last me between 3-18 months then the wire will develop a break (normal) but at these prices I can toss the bad and replace on the cheap.,Positive
"Jabra makes, by far the best hands-free devices on the market. The EarWave Boom is a good model that will satisfy 90% of people who need hands-free functionality for their cell phones.Jabra has gotten away from the full molded ear gels for this model.  I personally prefer them to the mini ear gels, but this unit fits fine in your ear with the ear wrap-around.  It's comfortable and works fine.As for the hands-free jack on your phone, you have to make sure you have a 2.5 millimeter jack. That is the one with 2 stripes on the plug. Calling this ""Universal"" is a little bit of an overstatement, but with a little research you can verify which model fits your phone.  Unfortunately, a specific compatibility list is hard to come by. Look at the specs for your phone and give it a try.The microphone will capture sound just fine.  For those who experience a lot of interference or muffling, I recommend you try the version with ""Noise Cancelling.""  It's about $7 more but for certain models of phone the difference can be worth it.The Jabra EarWrap has a slightly better wraparound attachment and a slightly longer arm. For those who don't like the microphone arm, the Jabra EarWave Bud doesn't have a microphone arm, but instead has the small mic on the cable with a clip to attach it to your tie or shirt. Personally I don't like those models.I have not found much difference in sound quality between the different Jabra models.  The differences are mainly in comfort, style, and ease of use.  This product is decently priced, but I think it could be more affordable.Try other higher end models if you are more demanding, like I am, and are willing to spend the money.  This is a pretty good model though, definitely enough to satisfy most users.",Positive
"Good, I was happy with this product.  I got tired of accidentally keeping my bluetooth earpiece in my jean pockets and sending them through the wash, so I bought this and it worked great until I bought a car that had bluetooth built-in.",Positive
"I got this because I had to use a non-Bluetooth cell phone for a while and I prefer talking hands-free.PROS: Confortable.  Very good sound quality. Cheap. Fits in my ear well enough that I'm able to keep the phone volume very low and still hear just fine.CONS: Corded.I've since gotten my Bluetooth phone back, but still keep this around in case the Bluetooth has problems.",Positive
Used this to replace an original with an old cell phone.  You can't beat the price and lasted years.  Thanks.,Positive
"I received this little gem for Christmas and now I refuse to speak into the phone itself.  This BT enabled unit is the perfect gift for anyone with a cell phone.No more complicated setups.  As soon as I turned this on, my Nokia found it, recognized it, associated it, and I was speaking into it.The battery life is great and the clarity is also dead on.Once you use this product, you too will never go back to speaking into your phone the old fashioned way.",Positive
"i had heard so many good things about this headset and even tried on my co-workers before i bought it, but what i didn't test out was the reception/range. i have been using a logitech mobile freedom headset for almost a year now and love it, EXCEPT for the fit. it fits horribly.this is where the BT205 shines. it fits great. it doesn't hurt. i can wear it for hours. it seems to have a ton of talk time (at least 6 hours, i would say)...but the reception just plain sucks. i don't know if it's all the electrical devices running in my apartment, but damn, i can't get more than about 5 feet away from my phone before this unit starts to get all crackly on me. you almost have to have the phone 1) within about 6 feet of you and 2) have it on the same side of your body as the jabra. basically, count on walking around with your phone in your pocket.do heed jabra's warnings about the wireless home network interfering with this device! and your microwave. and your electric fans...and running water...they all make reception horrible. i think my problem might have been the wireless home network. but c'mon people, us geeks who use bluetooth headsets are the same geeks who have wireless home networks. duh.summary:pros:*lightweight*comfortable*got a good price on ebay ($42 shipped for new)*easy to usecons:*range, range, range! this is a huge one for me. if i have to keep my phone within 6 feet of me all the time, what's the point?*too costly at $80 for what you get*everything interferes with this unit. you might as well go sit in a room with nothing in it for good reception.needless to say, it's for sale on ebay!",Positive
"I've been using my Jabra headset for a couple of weeks and have been very pleased with it. I bought it primarily for use while driving. It's very comfortable to wear. It has performed extremely well in the car. At times, I've used it at home. The range of the headset is quite good, but I get more static in my apartment. From time to time, I lose connection with my phone. I suspect that it's more a problem with my phone than with the headset...I only wish that the phone would come with a charger for the car as this is where I (and perhaps most people) will use the headset. In any case, I can highly recommend the Jabra headset.",Positive
"I bought 2 of these headsets (one for me and one for the girlfriend) on recommendation by my Cingular sales guy. It was either the BT250 for $80 or the Moto HS810 for $99.Not knowing too much about Bluetooth headsets at the time, I opted for the BT250. Two weeks later and I'm giddy like a kid in a candy store.It took a while to figure out how to install the headset to your ear, but I'm sure most, if not all, Bluetooth headsets share the same minor inconvenience. The other minor inconvenience are the buttons; they don't have a nice feel when you push them and the locations are sometimes tricky.If it's one thing I would REALLY like, then it's a replaceable [rechargeable] battery. I'd really hate to buy a new headset just because the battery will no longer hold a charge.Regardless, I have found the BT250 to be a better value than the HS810.",Positive
"I owned two versions of this unit. One with the Nokia 3650 (apparently the 3650 requires a specific type as compared to some of the other BT phones) and the second one that I currently own is with the Motorola V600.This comparison will cover both Jabra units and will compare them to the Nokia HDW-2 Blutooth adapter as well as the Motorola HS-820 bluetooth adapters.The jabra unit boasts a much better design. The other two sit on the ear and feel extremely awkward. The jabra design provides a much better and more comfortable fit even with glasses on. the other two has flimsy over the ear plastic pieces that feel very out of place.I felt this unit to be relatively easier to use as compared to the other two. I had NO problems teaming either of the units with the 3650. I did have to jump through a few hoops to team with the V600.THE most important reason I wanted a BT adapter in the first place was to due to the fact that i get a phone signal in my liviing room and there is no signal at my desk in the basement which is directly under the living room. The reception was about the same for both (not use-able). I also noticed that when I went around the corner, I would lose the signal. true for all units.All in all, I would rate each one as follows on a scale from 1 to 5:Quality : jabra-4, Nokia-3, Motorola-2.5Design: Jabra-5, Nokia-1, Motorola-1usabaility (range): Jabra-3, Nokia-3, Motorola-3usability (ease of use): Jabra-4, Nokia-3, Motorola-3Overall: Jabra-4, Nokia-2, Motorola-2One thing i did not get to test was the battery life. Jabra did provide a good two and a half days of battery time with a single charge. i did not get to test the battery life of either Nokia or Motorola units.",Positive
"Paired with a nokia 6230. Awesome headset. The battery life is pretty long. It feels really light on your ear and the sound is excellent.Some of these people must be going deaf or something because this thing can get loud. I never have the volume at max when I use this. And if this thing feels heavy on your ear, you must have ears the size of nickels. Or you're using two of them on the same ear...i don't know.Whenever I use this I sometimes forget I have them it until the unit rings... which makes me twitch because I'm not expecting a ring blasting thru my ear.I hate:-wind noise. You can't carry a conversation when you're driving with the windows down. or walking and the wind blowing in your face.-voice dialing may or may not work.-it makes my phone hang and reset. but that could be a phone problem in general.-30 feet? more like 10. 15 at best.",Positive
"I tried this out because my old Bluetrek that I loved died.  Actually, I killed it when I forgot where it was and sat on it.  I was impressed with the advertised battery life, and took the plunge.  Shouldn't have.  While it is SUPPOSED to work in a range of 33 feet, I found that if I merely put the phone on the opposite side of my body, the connection gets fickle.  You get lots of staticy noise if the phone is more than 2 feet from the earpiece and in a direct line of sight.  Sort of defeats the purpose of the bluetooth technology, doesn't it?  And the static is NOT just in your end; my girlfriend complained about it more than I really even heard it.  So if yo get this, be prepared to anger your party on the other line.  On the plus side, the sound is nice and loud in th speaker.  That's about it.  Try something else, like a bluetrek or motorola or something.  I am trying the Motorola next.  This thing is trash.",Positive
"I picked up this headset the other day and I'm relatively pleased with it. Despite a few bad reviews, the sound quality is acceptable for making telephone calls and dicatation, though the sampling rate is obviously too low to listen to music with it. I easily paired it with a Sony-Ericsson t68i and my 15"" Powerbook running Mac OS X 10.3.8.My quick testing with iChat AV was positive and it seems quite usable for use with an iSight for the voice portion of a call. I also was able to set the sound output to the headset and am currently listening to some music with it, but the low sample rate and the fact that it isn't in stereo makes this only a novelty. Nevertheless, it is still useful when a real pair of headphones are not available.The range, as mentioned in other reviews, isn't amazing, but was sufficient to move about an average-sized room and worked intermittently through a cinder block wall.It fit fairly comfortably on my ear and seems to easily hide, though is a bit cumbersome to put on at first. The multiple earpieces are also a plus. The dual charger/belt clip is an interesting idea, but seems to be poorly executed. It seems somewhat unstable, so I'm not sure I'd actually keep it on my belt. However, it might not be bad for riding around clipped to something inside of my backpack.All in all, it's not a bad device, though there is certainly some room for improvement. I'd probably buy it again, having used it for a little while.",Positive
"The light works exactly as expected.  As long as you are using your headset then the light will indicate that you are on the phone.  I do wish that the lights were a little brighter, or possibly multicolored.  We have an individual in the office that is color blind to red, so that would have been a nice touch.Also for obvious reasons, if you are using your handset, this light is not on.  I wish that the lifter had a feature that recognized when the handset was lifted by hand.  But that is a wish, not a product defect.Overall, I am happy with this device.",Positive
"Plug it in, stick it high on the wall above you, tape a Post-It ""ON PHONE WHEN LIT"" and you're done.Nobody's bothered me since!  The nice thing is even lifting the headset from the cradle activates the lights, so I can choose to avoid being disturbed even when I'm not on the phone.",Positive
"If you don't have your own office and/or you have co-workers who have a tendency of indiscriminately interrupting, pointing to flashing lights will effortlessly embarrass them into not interrupting you when you are on the phone!  In my case I bought the light as a courtesy to my co-workers; I am the first one in the office to wear a headset and they were uncomfortable approaching me whenever I was wearing it.  Now there is no question whether I am on the phone or not.  Easy to install, plug into lifter and place for greatest visibility (cord is about 5 feet long, secure with screw or double stick ""squares"").",Positive
"Easy to use and set up, works reliably, but in my workplace people walk in and see me facing away from the door, don't notice the light and start talking to me while I'm on the headset. I'd like to see Plantronics come out with a brighter or larger LED version, but otherwise, it works as advertised... now about those darn co works that don't pay attention to it, I don't know how to fix that!",Positive
"Magnetic mounting is a joke.  It is guaranteed to fall over, scratch your roof and generally be a pain in the buttocks.I wish this antenna were offered with a NMO mount.  It would be very nice to mount this securely, and well worth the trouble and effort to achieve a good mechanical and electrical connection to an auto roof.",Positive
"This antenna works well but the mini is better.  The main complaint is the wind whistels through the coil, so it must be set way back on the roof.  No sound from the mini dual band version and just as good reception.Update 5-28-10: Actually, the mini has much better reception",Positive
The only thing was that I wish the cable was like 5 ft longer. It doesn't exactly reach where I want it to go with out an extension.,Positive
"I tried a yagi antenna with my repeater, but never got a signal. I finally put this up on my metal (ground plane) roof. 2 or 3 bars inside, even though a phone outside in the same place has only 1 bar. Downgraded some because everything Wilson makes requires an adapter to plug into something else. Be sure you get the right adapter.",Positive
This was definitely easy to install. It can be removed and transferred from one vehicle to another. Adds just enough gain to work great.,Positive
Very please with the antenna but had to buy extra adaptor for it to fit my booster. Should have a bit more info.,Positive
"This didn't do much for me. Unfortunately, it may not be the blame. Ironically, I have a home repeater system after trying a couple of quick fixes (I thought). This was an upgrade to a combination home and mobile solution I tried first before realizing the specific product to get the results I needed for my whole house solution. So in the mobile world, I'm sure this would be helpful. It is the system as a whole that needs to be configured to a need which includes area of coverage, location, type of usage, cell frequency and more. So in putting a system together, for a whole home solution, you'd be wise to call on the manufacturer rather than putting pieces together which may not 'fit' the performance or compatibility of the other components in the system.",Positive
This headset was a piece of junk right out of the box. I had nothing but problems with it and threw it away after the first day.,Positive
"On the positive side the battery life is good.The negatives I'll split into ergonomics, sound and RF performance.Ergonomics: It's secure on my big ears, but as others have mentioned that seal is nothing more than marketing and window dressing. There aren't many ear mounted devices that I can get on with at all, so if you have big ears this may be for you.Sound: Received sound is weak at best, if you don't have good hearing this isn't going to work for you. Transmitted sound is also weak, apparently, I have to accept what others tell me. If I want to talk quietly I have to use the phone, the headset forces me to talk loudly so that I can be heard. Noise cancelling is non-existant, if it was supposed to have any. The draught from the AC vents on the car is enough to cause callers to complain.RF: With the v505 it takes an unreasonable amount of time for the headset and the phone to get it together. You can't answer the phone by switching the headset on when you hear it ringing, by the time it's connected to the phone the call is in voicemail. Received audio is OK, but whenever I used the headset I am told that I sound very digitized. As a communications engineer I believe that some people need a serious talking to over the bluetooth performance.All in all I'd keep looking, which is why I'm browsing headsets now.In ten years I really haven't yet found a ""good"" headset, nothing approaching the standard of the military and aviation headsets I used to use, like comparing a ZX80 to a 3GHz Dell Pentium 4. Perhaps I just have unreasonable expectations, but if I could actually get a headset with good audio and good noise cancelling I'd pay a couple of hundred bucks. A decent noise cancelling headset will let you talk in a normal voice while standing between the exhausts of a 1500hp tank engine.",Positive
"This might be the most comfortable BlueTooth headset out thereHowever, I've been very upset with connection speeds and call volumeMost people say that they can hear me very well ----- however, the connection speeds take forever to establish ---- in addition, the call volume is simply too low to even use it regularlyI use a Treo 650 --- I've heard that this headset works excellently with Moto products - your mileage may vary.....UPDATE: I have also tried the Moto 850 ---- sadly, it is really no better than the 810 --- there are some volume improvements, but the volume is simply too low on my Treo 650 ---- I recommend the Scala 500",Positive
"I have had this headset for several months now, and not liking much about this headset other than its long battery life. This headset works OK, but the sound quality is poor and it does not function well in conditions other than perfect, ie. no background or wind noise, and very close to handset. I do like the feature of the headset turning off, when boom mike closed because thats where the battery savings comes from. Other than that I find nothing redeeming about this headset, I believe Motorola will discontinue this model because of its severe flaws.",Positive
"This headset was purchased to replace TWO crappy jabra freespeaks.  This is very small, but unlike the goldlatern bluetreks or the Jabra, does not hide its mass well; it all sits right outside your ear, and in completely inconspicuous.  With my old bluetrek and even the jabra, my hair hid most of it, which for me is a plus, as I do not use Bluetooth headsets to impress people or get atttention; I don't want peoples attention and questions.Which is this headsets only drawback - it has this HUGE, BLUE ORB-LIKE LIGHT on it that takes up the whole front of the piece.  YOU WILL ATTRACT ATTENTION with this headset on.  It blinks in standby, it blinks when in operation, it blinks all the dang time.  But, if you can get passed that, it does work pretty well.  The sound is a little tinny, but pretty clear.  And unlike all my other bluetooth headsets, the headset volume only operates the headset, and doesn't link to the phone volume - this means that you have more adjustability for volume level and loudness, which is good.  The mic seems really good - no complaints from those on the other end, basically.  And the battery life isn't TOO ugly at 5 hours.  And the ear anchor could be a little more rigid and smaller for smaller ears, but it will do as long as you are not jogging around constantly.",Positive
"This product appears to be a genuine original equipment Blackberry car charger.  It has the Blackberry name and logo on it.  The plate on the bottom of the cigarette lighter plug of the unit states that the electric output is 5 volts, 500mA (500 milliamperes or .5 ampere).  The plate on the wall charger packaged with a new Blackberry 8800 states that the wall charger output is 5 volts, .75 ampere.  Thus, it appears that the car charger produces two thirds the electrical charge produced by the wall charger (.5 vs. .75 amp.)This car charger is used with a Blackberry 8800 and has performed admirably and without any problems.  It costs a fraction of the price charged by AT&T; ($29.99), apparently for the same product.",Positive
It works fine. I like it if I have any problems I will update you.,Positive
I have been using my Blackberry Curve for almost 2 years and only 3 times have I been able to run the battery to empty in one day. This car charger works as you would expect it to so if you're more addicted to your Blackberry then I am (and I am fairly glued to mine) this charger will keep your thumbs moving even longer then they probably should :) .,Positive
"I bought this to fit inside a kit that creates a storage space below my car stereo.  The pad has good grip on an ipod, my phone, and a couple pens while sticking to the smooth plastic.",Positive
"These things are great and work for a lot of areas, not just the car.  I actually use them on my art table to keep my items from moving that I use.",Positive
Not only is this sticky pad great to keep things from sliding but you can trim it to fit an area or 'shelf' on the dash.,Positive
"This pad is really good it works for the porpuse that is described, obvisly of you put something really big or something too round, it is going to fall with any movement of the car, but for the phone, glases, coints, some small papers, etc. it works and is really easy to remove and replace in any part of the car board. Highly recomendable.Note: It also looks nice in black car boards.",Positive
"I put this sticky pad on top of a cup holder cover i have on my Honda Accord 2010. I tend to put ipods or my cellphone there and whenever the car moves it slides out and falls to the car's floor. Using this sticky pad, it prevents that for me.It is easy to remove if you decide to get rid of it altogether. You don't have to stick it permanently on any part of your car.Things that don't bother me about it but should be noted.It doesn't stay on the cover that well.Its like it could fall off if there was enough dust between it and the cover.Just like any other sticky thingie, this thing can easily collect dust. It looks like you can just wash it off though. I haven't tried.Update:Yep you can just pull it off, wash it, dry it properly (overnight) and put it back where it was.I bought a 2nd one so that I can put stuff on the dashboard now. So I can use the cupholder.",Positive
"Item was purchased for spouse.  Was not what he really wanted, but the item does work for the most part.",Positive
"I always have triable keeping my phone from moving when in my sports car. I like to keep my phone close to my hands and this sticky pad allows me to do exactly that even when I make a sharp turn. The phone alway stays in place. If it gets a bit dusty, you can wash it and is as good as new again.",Positive
"Works as advertised.  It's a tacky pad that is non-adhesive and keeps stuff from sliding around on the dashboard.  Problem with the iPhone (4S) is that the back is a flat panel of Gorilla Glass and does not lift easily off the Sticky Pad.  Instead, it tends to lift the Sticky Pad off the dashboard by sticking itself to the back of the iPhone.  I'm sure the problem would be solved by using an iPhone cover, but then if I did I wouldn't need the Sticky Pad at all.",Positive
"I bought a similar one @ a local store & was surprised how well it held my phone, my sons phone & iPod.  I pd almost $6 & it is 1/2 the size of this one.  I needed another one & it looked bigger. Wow!! It's bigger, I have a. Portable fan even on one of these!!  I loved it so much, I bought another one. WARNING.... This has NOTHING to do w/ the product itself, BUT if u use this for your phone, iPod & it's HOT outside & u have this on ur dashboard... DO NOT put your phone or iPod on it!! My phone over heated!!!! Thank goodness it ok my phone.... But u live & learn. I also keep loose change on it... Glasses... Small toys stay too!!!!  Enjoy !!",Positive
"Like so many other reviewers, I had this Think Outside Stowaway ""collecting dust"" as I had bought it for an older phone.  I was actually looking on Amazon for a foldable keyboard and came across this and these reviews.  So I found my Stowaway (quicker than I thought I might!), did not load the software that came with it (as the instructions tell you to do), but just decided to see if it would sync with my Playbook.  First, of course, I had to put 2 AAA batteries in it and, VOILA, it worked!!!  I am a happy camper!!!  As another reviewer said, it is surprising that some other manufacturer hasn't continued this concept in folding keyboards.",Positive
I just paired this with my Hisense Sero Pro and it works great. I've tried many portable keyboards but none with this build quality and keyboard comfort. Truly feels like a real keyboard that folds up small. The stand holds my 7 inch tablet well. No more lugging around my laptop. This is all I need.,Positive
"The driver for this device completely broke my Treo 650, fortunately I have Sprint's insurance plan so I was able to get a replacement Treo. I used the latest driver from the Thinkoutside website. If you have a Treo do not get this device.",Positive
This is a great Bluetooth keyboard that is very compact and easy to use. It does work for Android and iDevices and has a shelf for you device to rest on so you can see the screen while you type.,Positive
"The iGo Stowaway Ultra-Slim Bluetooth Keyboard is truly portable.  Running on two AA batteries, you can easily carry spares around.  Only gripe about this product is that it lacks a dedicated number row (for 1 to 0).  Else, it would be perfect.",Positive
"I just love this keyboard. I've used it with my HTC and now with my unlocked iphone using BTstack Keyboard from Cydia. The only issue is that it really needs an extra row of keys. The numbers and symbols are placed on the top row of letters (where the letters QWERTYUIOP are in the keyboard). To access a number, you need to press the left function key and the corresponding letter. To type a symbol, you need to press the right function key and the corresponding letter. I work in finance and many of my annotations need numbers and symbols, like 10% for example. For that, it takes a long time. I find it easier to type ""ten pc"" instead of 10%.I'll buy a new keyboard just for that. But besides this, the keyboard is just amazing. So if you don't need your numbers and symbols too often, I really recommend it.",Positive
"First off, I have had this product since 2007 and was fortunate to catch it at a great bargain!!  Since then, I have not had one problem with it except when I forget to change the batteries!I have been able to successfully pair and use this keyboard with originally a Samsung I760, then a HTC Touch Pro 2 and now my Motorola Xoom tablet.  I was surprised that I didn't even have to download drivers, it worked once I simply paired it.Not having number dedicated keys was a sacrifice but I can type memos, emails or simply work on a novel at anytime conveniently by having this portable keyboard.  The keyboard itself is very durable and has a sturdy feel when you are typing.",Positive
"It seems that this keyboard acts a little like those gold fish you bring home in a plastic bag from the pet shop.  You have to put the whole bag in the tank until it acclimates to it's new surroundings.  I went from wanting to love the thing for the sheer coolness factor....to boxing it up to send back when it wouldn't sync to my Axim x50v....to giving it another chance and after it was good and ready to work flawlessly, I now love it again.  The keyboard is smaller than standard but very useable.  It's great for writing a longer e-mail, inputting contacts, or writing a letter in word, when you don't want to peck at the screen with your stylus endlessly.  The construction feels solid and opening and closing is a snap.  Pun intended. The only major flaw is with the cradle that holds your PDA.  It is removable which is the desired use to space the PDA a little further away from you.  But the feet that clip it to the keyboard just don't want to let go.  The plastic it's made out of doesn't seem especially robust and I feel certain it will snap off eventually.  Also the curved lower part of the cradle that holds your Axim, et al, is a little under developed and if bumped will readily jettison what it's holding.  Other than that it works very well and never ceases to make me grin when everyone passing your table at Starbucks has to stop and ask you about it. I previously gave it one star, but now that it's acclimated and working I give it 4 only because of the cradle shortcoming or else it would have been a full 5.  I know it shows one star, but Amazon wholdn't allow me to edit the scale.",Positive
"Great sturdy design in every aspect. After pairing, it features flawless instant connection to your device every time you open it. A keeper for long, its quality shows it'll last for ages.I just wish iGO would start working on supporting Windows Mobile 6. It does perform as a keyboard should and it does carry out it's core functionality; but, I can't find the drivers for my device or any other WM6 device for that manner. I am currently using similar ones which, though do allow the device to work, don't allow all function keys to carry their purpose or softkey support to be accurate.",Positive
"Once you get a keyboard for your pda / smart phone, you won't go back. This keyboard communicates via bluetooth and does a great job at turning your small device into a productive tool you won't want to be without. I use this keyboard with my Palm TX and it does a fabulous job during meetings - it's small (smaller than a notebook), VERY portable and reliable. the entire keyboard as well as my Palm PDA fits into the pant pocket of my cargo pants / shorts. You really can't get much more portable than that.To use you invoke a 3-button key combination to help it initiate contact with your device. Once connected, you'll be off and running. My Palm TX will only stay on at 1-3 minute intervals so the only thing I don't like about this combination is that I have to keep hitting a key once in a while so my Palm doesn't shut off. This of course is a design flaw of the TX and not reflective of the keyboard.",Positive
"This keyboard fills my left pocket and my ""Ultra mobile PC phone"" fills my right pocket.  This keyboard allows me to type at normal speed on a device I can keep in my pocket, and I was astonished to see that it would have even worked for text messaging on my older phone, the Nokia N-Gage.  If you have any HTC phone or any phone that supports bluetooth or this keyboard, or even a PDA, I highly recommend this product, although it is costly.  Pair it with anything that can run TextMaker Office for WindowsMobile and you have a meeting powerhouse in your pocket that can tackle the best college note taking in a much more mobile manner than a laptop, since you don't need to take it out of a bag, plug it in, and otherwise waste time.  I also suggest pairing it with the mouse by the same company for the same purpose.",Positive
"I purchased this keyboard so that I could start doing some serious word processing on my Treo 650, and I've been absolutely pleased!First off, the keyboard does not come with the Treo 650 driver --- you must DOWNLOAD THIS DRIVER OFF OF THINK OUTSIDE'S websiteHowever, downloading the driver is easy, and from there, you can sync it to your Treo, or email it, in an attachment, to itOnce the drive is installed, the keyboard is flawless!My biggest complaint about BlueTooth keyboards is that they lag, as you type ---- but this is not the case with the Stowaway --- every key I pressed showed up INSTANTLY upon my Treo 650So far, it has worked terrificly with my address book, calendar, and email (VersaMail)In addition, the keyboard folds together well and is EXTREMELY thin and portable ---- I don't know if you could carry it in a pocket - but a backpack, briefcase, etc will not feel any extra weight with this productlastly - these keyboards are small --- I wish the delete key was bigger (as I often make typos) but nonetheless, I'm very happy, and certainly, typing on this quicker than the phone's keyboardhighly recommended!HAPPY TYPING! HAPPY BUYING!",Positive
"Originally created for use with Palm devices, the iGo Stowaway Ultra-Slim Bluetooth Keyboard for PDAs and Handhelds is still among the best folding, nearly full-sized Bluetooth keyboards available. Its metal case and relatively simple folding mechanism result in a durable product that has given me years of reliable service. The keyboard feels great; the throw of the keys is nice and tactile feedback is on a par with many laptop keyboards. My fingers are none too slim and they easily fit on to this keyboard. Like many of us, these days, I'm a touch typist and I find using this keyboard as comfortable as any I might find, particularly on most laptop computers. I've owned a couple of these - not because they wear out (I still own and use the first one I purchased, nearly a decade ago) - but because I find it's useful to have one at my bedside and another in my gear bag.Powered by AAA batteries makes it easy to operate. There's no proprietary power source or charging system required. It sips power, too; I find it lasts and lasts on a pair of NiMH rechargeable batteries.Pairing with a phone or other device is very simple. However, my Symbian phones do not handle this as they should any authorized peripheral. I have to manually connect; I cannot just turn the keyboard on and start to type, in order to get the keyboard and phone to connect. I suspect this a deficiency with the Symbian OS and not with the keyboard.The folding stand is very useful and fits a variety of devices of roughly phone-size, in either a portrait or landscape configuration.Even without its zippered case, this keyboard travels very nicely and has a durable aluminum shell.Why didn't I give this a perfect 5-star rating? The keypad is available, I think, only with the functions of the old Palm OS mapped on to the keys. It doesn't undermine the use of the keyboard with other operating systems, but can sometimes be distracting that the keys are printed with functions either not available on your phone's operating system or the keys cannot actually perform that function.I find it very unfortunate that most so-called ""smart phones"" do not support mapping special functions on to Bluetooth keyboards. Admittedly, this is not a shortcoming of the keyboard itself. Phone manufacturers are simply more interested in equipping their systems with eye-candy and games, rather than the kinds of productivity enhancements which might make their devices more useful to those of us who try to rely upon them to aid is in our work and home lives.It is astonishing to me that this keyboard isn't more popular and being emulated by other manufacturers. It would be terrific if it were to ship with software that could enable iOS, Android, and Symbian devices to map functions to its keys.I highly recommend this keyboard, if you are looking for a durable, reliable, and comfortable folding Bluetooth keyboard for your handheld device.",Positive
"It is so funny watching text fly into my T-Mobile SDA smartphone (aka iMate SP5m or HTC Tornado) using the Stowaway keyboard. This keyboard is all class: just like a laptop keyboard, with the same spring to the keys, quality, durability and lovely looks to boot.Entering numbers is get-used-to'able, however symbols such as () and & or % can be a major pain, due to the fact that a) you have to use ""custom"" key commands using ctrl, fn1 and fn2 buttons and b) if you are an experienced typer, you ""already know"" the ""motion"" for & or * or (), and you'll find yourself doing them! (meaning you are incorrect, on this keyboard)That said, entry is obviously very fast and natural as this is a proper keyboard, just with some multi-purposed keys requiring key combos.The only solution is to FORCE yourself through it and just do it. You will get used to it, just like you got used to fast touch-typing.Anyhow, this thing is a gem for hammering out quick SMS text messages, etc. I mean no more ""click-click-click, clack-clack, click-click-click-click, clack-clack"" to type out a single four-letter word. Nothing feels quite like that lol!This thing will fit EASILY in a purse and will fit in a men's pant pocket. I wear shorts, pants, etc. and it fits fine.The keyboard clicks are quite silent. I use this in class to quicly type out extensive class notes, as I can type far faster (and more legibly) than I can hand-write.The case is durable sandblasted aluminum (like my old minidisc player) and the detachable device stand is sweet! I use it all the time to put my phone on one of those little chair-mounted desks in class, and type in my lap. Sweet!Anyhow, is this thing essential? I mean, I kinda hate not having a notebook around when in, say, a statistics class with graphs and stuff...you can't draw graphs with this thing very well. However, for text-based notes in a college setting, this thing is well worth it. A smartphone as above and a keyboard, and you have one of THE major functions of a laptop, but without having to carry a laptop. Just the phone you'd have anyways, and this flat little thing.NOTE: if you have troubles reconnecting this thing, use the bluetooth connect on your phone first, then use the special driver provided by Think Outside to finish the connection. Two part process.In all, I am a college student and I wish I did not have to pay over $80 for this unit (why can't they make it for $30?), but in the end this thing is slightly sweeter than it's price, so it's worth it.",Positive
"I bought this to work with a Palm T3, years ago. They never produced good Palm drivers so it was pretty much worthless. It's been sitting in a drawer for five years and some of the keys stick, but they can be prised up with the corner of a credit card. The keyboard syncs cleanly with an iPad 2 and, if you can tolerate the way it rocks back and forth as you type, it works fine.",Positive
"It always worries me when devices like this are still being sold at retail, while third party sellers are able to sell them for under what wholesale would seem to be for the stated retail price. Usually this reflects a liquidation by the manufacturer. But sometimes that allows you to try a gadget that you otherwise might not be able to afford. And if you need the gadget for its originally designed purpose, it may well be just what you want, despite being obsolescent. It is pure speculation on my part, but I believe that the market need now requires F1-F12 keys and this device does not have them.I've considered PDA keyboards before but they always impressed me as flimsy junk, not possibly able to stand up to the rigors of travel or even more than occasional use. This one is different - I believe that if I put it in its little paddded bag it could go into my black bag and come out after 6 trips, two weeka later, in the same shape, ready to go when I needed it.  The aluminum construction seems as solid as it poaaibly can for a folding device.When I look at the support forums for the device on the manufacturer's web site, I see that people are asking about support for portable windows devices.  This keyboard has no traditional windows function keys (originally F1-F10, now (and for many years) F1-F12) [Sidebar: Why 12?  Because that is how many the IBM 3270, a special purpose mainframe terminal used by the designers had] and without those you probably can't use it effectively with windows. I paired it with my laptop, and I was able to use it as a keyboard, without special drivers.  Probably, with a great free program called anyhotkey I could get it to simulate the sending of pfks using extra non-momentary shifts, but why?  A wireless or wired full sized keyboard is what you need on a system like this.I had no trouble getting used to left (blue) function shifting for numbers and right (green) function shifting for top line punctuation, although I wish the silk screening had been against an ivory background and not the gunmetal grey one.  While it might be possible for a driver to use multiple shifts to simulate F1-F12, what then about shifted keys? If the shift to get F4 includes a chord with the alt key, how would you then type alt-F4? The only possible way I could see was if this was something that you got by pushing both blue and green shifts and the top line, but if you then accidentally hit cntl, you'd put the keyboard into pairing mode.So I believe that they are, as I write this, available at a great price for their intended market - Palm PDAs, Some Smartphones, and such. But not having function keys limits this keyboard's future, specifically Windows Mobile devices that can be used with a full Bluetooth keyboard won't be fully functional when you use this device as a keyboard.One other thing that I did was to try it with my PS3.  Works great, and the PS3 does not use F1-F12, so this is probably the perfect occasional use keyboard for the PS3 - you can text with it, or type addresses if you are surfing, or use it for naming things without having to have a full sized keyboard wired to the PS3 (or a full sized bluetooth keyboard taking up space). Nothing special, I just paired it and then typed the number the PS3 gave me on its screen.My main use for this is as a keyboard formy Palm T|X. I downloaded the drivers and synced the T|X.  I then went through setting up a secure connection. The only thing that I do not like (and I am not sure what to do about it) is that whenever I want to use the keyboard, I can't just open it up and start using it. I have to open it, go to applications, start the keyboard application, go into bluetooth configuration, tell it to connect, dismiss the warning that the keyboard has to be paired in the device list, and then do the cntl-greenFN-blueFN chord to make the keyboard discoverable. Then it connects and the keyboard works, and I can change to another application and the keyboard still works.This needs to be done often enough that I made an input area icon (the touchscreen areas that allow you to immediately bring up an application) start the keyboard app.I believe that this is an issue with the way the Palm OS works. Other systems don't seem to need this manual restart of the drivers.Once that is done, so long as the palm does not need to be reset, the keyboard will work as soon as it comes on - so long as you do not use another bluetooth device. According to the release notes, the Palm Bluetooth support can only talk to one device at a time. If the keyboard is unused, it will power down after a couple minutes. But when you touch a key, it will resume communications immediately, without going through the menu. No, it is not a full sized keyboard, and there are some compromises, but it has a really good feel, even compared to many full sized keyboards I own.When one opens the keyboard, the first thing to do is to extend the palmtop support. The little arm that the palmtop rests on is spring loaded, and pops past a stop - if you like it at that first stop, be careful to block the rest with your thumb. There is a release on one side to open the keyboard, a release on the top that holds the keyboard open and which needs to be released when you want to close it. Just go slow.There is a single feedback light.  Off? Keyboard is not connected. Fast blink? Keyboard is ready to connect. Slow blink? Keyboard is connected. Red? Low battery.Simple, easy to use, and works well. This is not a PC keyboard, and it is not a heavy stationary keyboard. For what it is sold for, it is best of breed.",Positive
"I received the item in a timely manor, but the best thing about this product, was the outstanding response I received by the seller. It was an excellent purchase experience and excellent customer service.  I would buy from this seller again.  I was unable to make the item work with my blackberry 8310, and the seller provided me the opportunity to return it for a full refund, however, my life got busy and the time alloted to return it expired, but that's my fault and not the seller.",Positive
"Use it for my Nokia N95-3 and it works very well.A bit bulky since its not really pocketable but fits in any bags for easy transport.Great for using it on airplanes since it is small and will not take up the entire table.Some keys are very touchy since I noticed that the ""E"" button will press twice.All in all a very nice product!",Positive
"I have the version designed and manufactured for Dell by Think Outside, Inc.  It is the same as this product but the keys are black.  The keyboard works great.  The keyboard folds up flat and is about 4""x6"" and it is thin.  It folds out to a full size keyboard, when opened the keyboard latches so it won't fold up when you are typing and the keys have a great feel.  Loading the software to my Axim x30 and configuring the keyboard went smoothly and although I am somewhat comfortable with technology  I am not a ""techie"" by any measure.  The bluetooth is great and there is no need to carry cables and wires and this option has worked well for me for the past two years.The only problem I have is with the stand.  The stand is made with very flimsy plastic; although the manual says that it is detachable I would recommend extreme caution. After two years of extremely careful treatment my stand broke.I don't know if Think Outside, Inc. will sell me this plastic part (I plan to contact them) but Dell does not stock or sell this part even though it is detachable; it does not take a genius to see that this part will not wear well.  After being transferred to four departments and then told to call their parts store the fifth Dell customer service representative told me to either purchase a new keyboard for $99.00 or carry my cradle around.  This seems silly and wasteful.If you work from one location and can use your cradle to hold your Pocket PC this is not an issue.  But if like me you purchased this for travel and portability and do not take your cradle with you this is a problem.So this is a great product with the above exception.  As a consumer I hope that manufacturers begin to learn that when you purchase something like this you expect quality.  It should not only work well but hold up under normal use and parts should be made available and easy to find.-Feb. 21, 2006Update:  I contacted Think Outside Inc. through their website.  They sent me two replacement stands free of charge.  The customer service department was nice and I got the stands within three business days.  Great customer service!-Feb. 24, 2006Another Update:  I am still using the keyboard and it still works great and my replacement stand is holding up and I still have the extra they sent me.  I would purchase this again and I wish sellers like Dell knew to direct customers who experienced the problem I did to Think Outside for replacement parts.  They had excellent customer service unlike Dell (they wanted me to purchase another keyboard).-Sept. 15, 2006",Positive

"I bought these to replace my LG headset which kept dropping audio during phone calls.  The sound quality is very good.  It has a longer range than the LG. Overall very pleased.  The software that runs the headset is not as advanced as the LG, it doesn't announce the battery level and it can only be connected to one device at a time.  When it announces it is connected, if two of your devices have bluetooth on at the same time, you don't know which one it is connected to because it does not identify the unit it is connected to.Overall, though, I like them a lot.  The sound quality is very important to me and I wear them a lot when I am listening to programs on netflix and for my day-to-day phone use.",Positive
I was hoping for a blue tooth that will connect to more than one phone. I already had the LG and was hoping the Motorola would do better but I was let down. It is a great buy if you are only using one cell phone.,Positive
The headset sounds excellent.  The earbuds will not aggravate your ears when they are in... even for long lengths of time.  I would definitely recommend these.,Positive
"Update: I've been asked how they hold up with sweat (see below). No problem working up a sweat on the treadmill, but I must stress that I've not put in a summer run. I also must say that I do not expect longevity from a non-sweatoroof product, and that the s11 headphones are designed with a sweatproof nano coating. HOWEVER, since you asked, they still sound and work excellent. They bounce around running, but it's not intolerable... Just not ideal.  BATTERY: I've used them every day since I got them, and often times days at the house studying all day and going to the gym.  They last from morning to night constantly connected.  I often forget I'm wearing them when I turn on my music and don't hear any sound from my phone/tablet.Edit: just for the record, the Motorola site says these are NOT for working out (under questions about product, it says not sweatproof and should be kept away from moisture). I'm going to work out in them anyway and I'll report back when they fail.=============================================================I bought the jaybird bluebuds x for my girlfriend, and I've used them several times, so that is my comparison point.These headphones have a very utilitarian, price conscious design. They don't sound as awesome as the $180 bluebuds, and they aren't as sleek as them (bluebuds are just a cord with tiny ear pieces). BUT, they are very easy to control, very light, and sound very good. I'm not taking away anything by saying they don't sound as good as the bluebuds... The bluebuds sound as good as Bose or klipsch wired models of similar cost (even MKBHD says they are amazing). The Motorola buds really sound great. I'd choose them based on sound over any of the cheaper wired sets I have (skull candy, JVC, etc.)The ear pieces, at first, I was worried about them. They didn't look like they would be very secure, but I was wrong. You can easily work out with them and they will stay in. And they swivel a bit at the ear pieces, so every time you move, you don't hear a bunch of thumping like many in-ear wired sets.And taking them out to hear the world around you is nice, because of the magnets. No flopping around.The built-in equalizer settings are nice, the controls are easy, and they stay around your neck when laying on your back.So you sacrifice some portability over the bluebuds, but you get a great ease of use, very good sound, and less than half the price.And truthfully, while they aren't super stylish... People are walking around with those giant beats studio headphones on. These look way less ridiculous than that, and really aren't that bad. Don't wear them to a job interview.",Positive
"Pro'sUnit has great range.Comfortable in the ears, can wear it all day.Battery life is awesome.Mute function make this very useful for someone that spends a lot of time on the conference calls.Con'sLasted two months and now will not turn on anymore. Trying to get motorola to fix it, but no help so far.Audio books may have issues. The headset will cut out during short pauses and makes you lose out on a few seconds of the story as it reconnects. Only certain books caused this behavior.If it did not quit on me I would certainly recommend it as a phone headset.",Positive
"It's so so.  Not as comfortable as advertised and hugs your neck which i hate.  Has great sound but  is quite plain. I own an older LG model bigger for guys my size.... Has more control buttons for the different functions compared to the 2 buttons the Motorola has.The off/on button is in a bad place, every time I lay on the bench to lift weights I lay on the button which shuts it off ...Poor design. I wouldn't say not to buy it but a gadget person as myself I prefer the LG so I returned the Motorola and ordered a newer LG model ..",Positive
These ear buds are just wonderful.  Let's you listen privately to anything you need to and still participate in daily activities.  I would highly recommend.,Positive
"I bought these after TWO sets of LG Tones broke on me. I like these a lot. Very comparable to the Tones. What was most important to me was battery life. I used these for listening to sports and talk radio. I have wired buds for listening to music. The only two complaints I have with this item is: the neck band is kinda tight in comparison to the Tone. Not as easy to get on and off. However, they don't move around as much as the Tone's. My second complaint: the on/off. I have to take the headset off to access the switch. The Tone's switch is a much better setup and easily accessible. All in all, I would recommend these. I am hoping the quality is better than that of the LG Tone.",Positive
"VERY COMFORTABLE, CLEAR VOLUME AND GREAT FITTTING AROUND YOUR NECK. DON'T TURN AROUNDYOUR NECK AS MUCH AS THE LG. GREAT",Positive
"I lost my 2-year-old LG Tone HBS-700 headset and someone else is doubtless enjoying it.The Motorola cables appeared to be more robust than the LG cables and the price point was attractive compared to the newest LG HBS-800, so I decided to take a chance.The good:- price- earbud fit- strong cables- battery life- reception- button function and placement- pairing- telephone functionThe bad:- looks goofy- the band is a tight fit- two-tone cable color may as well be illuminated with a sign that says, ""look at me!""The mediocre:- sound quality (richness and frequency response) simply cannot match the LG Tone HBS series- equalizer is not very effective (bright treble but non-existent bass)Summary:This product is inferior to the LG where it counts:  the sound.  For me, that is sufficient reason to warrant return of this product and purchase of the newest and ridiculously expensive LG Tone HBS-800.  I am returning the Motorola this week, but I will delay my purchase of the LG until the price becomes more reasonable.  In the meantime, I'll get by with a wired pair of earbuds.",Positive
"SPOILER ALERT: this is a stupidly long review. I like to provide as much detail as possible when I write a review, because that&8217;s the sort of thing I look for in other reviews. Buying things from online retailers is great and all, but it prevents us from getting any hands-on information until we&8217;ve already shelled out our money. Detailed reviews are the best way to combat disappointment and buyers&8217; remorse. So either get some popcorn and/or a coffee, or skip to the end, or skip this review entirely &61514;  Seriously though, it&8217;s a long review. Prepare yourself.This headset is about as close to ideal as I'm probably ever going to get, at least until headsets are implanted subdermally behind the ear, or when music and communications are beamed directly into the brain or something. It has great sound, features, fit, and looks. There are a few downsides which I'll get out of the way first, and then I can get back to gushing about this thing. First, I feel that the earbud cords are maybe .5 to .75 inches too short. I wear this mainly when I&8217;m at work, underneath the collar of my polo shirt. The cords therefor have to dip down under the edge of the collar, and then make the trip back up to my ears. It's fine if I'm looking straight ahead, but if I turn my head too much it will tug on the 'outside' ear (if I look left, it tugs on my right ear and vice versa). I've gotten around this somewhat by removing the little silicone o-rings that are intended to manage the earbud cords. It releases a little more cord length so the tugging is less noticeable, but it is still there. The cords are a bit short for my taste even when wearing a t-shirt, but aren&8217;t too bad. The next downside is that the headset does not support connection to two devices at once. I get that this &8220;one device at a time&8221; thing improves the handoff between music and calls, since this is easier when both services are provided by one phone/device, but I still wish I could listen to my personal phone's music collection while being able to take calls from my work phone. Other headsets like the Sony MW600 handle this with ease. I should clarify that the Buds can be PAIRED with multiple devices, but can only be connected to one device at a time. Currently, I&8217;ve got them paired with my Android tablet and phone, my iPod, and my work iPhone. I can switch from one to another by manually disconnecting from one and connecting to another (via each device&8217;s settings), so I don&8217;t have to go through the pairing process every time I want to switch &8211; pairing the Buds is not difficult at all, but that would get annoying real quick.Now that I've got that out of the way, I can talk about the stuff I like about the Buds, which is pretty much everything. First off, let me assure you that this headset DOES support Apt-X Bluetooth connections where available. Apt-X is a Bluetooth audio codec that is designed to provide sound quality equal to a wired headset. Other Bluetooth audio connections have to compress the audio, making it sound somewhat muddled and, well, bad. This happens regardless of the quality of your source audio file. Apt-X support is most commonly available in recent Samsung (including the Galaxy S3, S4, and S5) and HTC phones (including the One and M8), but there are others out there as well. If you&8217;re interested, there is a ridiculously complete .xlsx spreadsheet available from jessebandersen dot com, but a simple Google search will also yield results. I found Jesse&8217;s page by searching for &8220;aptx enabled devices&8221; &8211; it was the first result in the list. Sadly Apt-X is not supported by Apple yet, and knowing them they'll come out with some proprietary alternative to it that only works with their own headsets (they bought Beats by Dre in the last week or so, so get ready). I almost passed on the Buds because Apt-X isn't listed anywhere in the specs or reviews that I saw here on Amazon. I had to go to Motorola's site and look up the user manual to find it. I was originally going to go with the LG Tone headset line (which also supports Apt-X), but didn't like the &34;flat loop&34; design that most of them have &8211; it looks like a great fit&8230; for a robot. In my opinion the Buds are designed for a better fit on an actual human: the front of the control stalks bend gently down, following the curve of the neck/shoulders/collarbones. The majority of the headset (including the very small weight of the battery pack) rests on the base of your neck, and the control stalks rest comfortably near the collarbones. The LG Tone can't do both at the same time since it is formed in a flat circle: the stalks aren&8217;t angled relative to the neck band, and they carry all the weight of the battery so they&8217;ll fall to your collarbones while the center section will be halfway up the back of your neck (the newer ones are curved like the Buds, but are $70 more expensive). I&8217;m wearing the Buds headset right now, and can hardly feel it &8211; a great improvement over traditional &8220;earhugger&8221; Bluetooth headsets. While I&8217;m talking about fit, I should probably mention that I wear a 17.5&8221; collar, and can&8217;t stand having things touching my neck or throat. The Buds fit quite comfortably, and provide just the slightest reassuring touch on the front sides of my neck. They widest gap between the left and right control stalks measures just a hair under 5 inches.The Buds have a tidy control arrangement and are easy to navigate. Play/pause/answer/end/track-skip commands (as well as EQ settings and voice dial activation) are handled by a rocker switch on the left, and volume adjustments are handled by a rocker switch on the right. The microphone is underneath the rocker switch on the left, and the power switch is underneath the body (center section) of the headset, next to the charging port. Play/pause/answer/end is done by a single press of the forward half of the left rocker switch, which has a little bit of texture to it for identification/grip purposes. You can activate voice dialing (like Siri or Samsung&8217;s S-Voice or Google voice search) by long-pressing this same button while no music is playing. Track-skip forward is done by a single press of the back half of the same switch, and track-skip back is done by a double press. I kind of wish skip forward/back were handled by separate buttons, but it&8217;s easy enough to get used to. One thing to note about the mic being on the same stalk as the answer/end button: if you have to feel around for the end call button, the person on the other end is going to hear ALL OF IT since the microphone is right beneath it. Lots of loud rustling noises. Oops. Not enough for me to list as a full-on downside, but still... kind of annoying. They could have placed the mic on the right, which come to think of it is a whole lot less &8220;busy&8221; since it mostly only has volume control functions. Volume down is achieved by pressing the forward half of the right rocker switch, and volume up by pressing the back half. You can mute an active phonecall by pressing both portions of the volume rocker, and reject an incoming call by long-pressing either one of the volume buttons. EQ modes can be changed by a long-press of the &8220;Play/Pause&8221; switch on the left. There are 3 EQ modes, but there is no indication of which one you are in, or documentation of what the effects are supposed to be. There is a voice notification of &8220;EQ mode changed!&8221; but that&8217;s it. You&8217;re on your own to figure out exactly what that means. My best guess is that the modes are flat, treble boost, and bass boost. As a general &8220;audiophile&8221; rule, flat EQ response is best since it doesn&8217;t meddle with the sound balance and you hear it as the artist intended. I can barely tell which EQ mode is bass boost, but can&8217;t tell the difference between the other two. And if I can&8217;t tell the difference, then I guess it doesn&8217;t really matter. I&8217;d recommend switching modes while listening to your general type of music, getting to an EQ setting you like, and then never changing it again. As is obvious from the pictures and literature, the earbuds are held magnetically to the ends of the control stalks when not in use. The magnets are pretty strong, and the earbuds have yet to bounce themselves loose. In fact, they are so strong that if I remove an earbud from my ear but don&8217;t attach it to the end of the stalk, I&8217;ll eventually find that it has connected itself at some point as I&8217;ve been moving around. Needless to say, don&8217;t get any of these parts too close to any of your credit cards.As far as sound quality goes, I&8217;m really impressed. The earbuds are said to have &8220;Premium HD speakers&8221;, and whatever that truly means, they sound great and the Apt-X support really helps them shine. I should point out that the Buds will still sound great with non-Apt-X devices like Apple gadgets, and will certainly sound as good as all other Bluetooth headsets that don&8217;t support it. As long as the earbuds are seated properly (which is critical with any in-ear earbuds) bass response is nice and solid, and everything just sort of sparkles. Not saying that &8220;sparkle&8221; is added in any way, but if the music has fine detail in it then you&8217;ll hear a lot more of it. Speaking of having the earbuds seated properly, the documentation talks a bit about about &8220;micro-adjustability&8221;, and what this translates into is that the stem of each earbud can pivot a certain amount around a central axis in a sort of narrow cone shape, so the angle of the stem relative to the earbud&8217;s body can change a bit to fit different peoples&8217; ear structures. The earbuds seem to stay fairly well seated unless I get really sweaty. Speaking of sweat, I will also note that the Buds are not labelled as &8220;sweat proof&8221;, which does make me worry a little bit. I sweat easily, and do a lot of biking and walking, and my work is somewhat physical too. Hopefully this does not become an issue. There is a little rubber plug you have to partially remove to access the charging port, so make sure you place it back securely before getting sweaty. Anyways, back to audio quality: One important thing to note, which is true of all high quality sound delivery devices, is that the final output depends highly on good source material. You should know by now that low quality sources like 128Kbps .mp3 files or even some tracks on Pandora and other streaming services aren&8217;t the best, and with these you will hear every little bit of their badness. Other headsets may mask this but they&8217;re also masking the fine detail of better quality files, so in a way it&8217;s actually a good thing. Call quality on both ends of the line is really good as well, and I&8217;ve never had anyone ask &8220;Are you using Bluetooth?&8221; which I usually get when I use other headsets. In fact, I had one person stop me in mid-conversation and ask &8220;Didn&8217;t you say you were going to put on your bluetooth headset?&8221;, and almost didn&8217;t believe me when I said I already had. One last thing about audio quality &8211; if you listen to music via any app with preamp gain, you may want to be reduce that gain level to zero. I use PowerAmp on my Galaxy S4 and was dismayed at first to hear a ton of distortion, especially in the low end. I almost returned the headset because I could not get rid of it. I eventually found that the preamp gain (on PowerAmp&8217;s EQ settings page) was set to about 75% of its capacity, and turning it down eliminated the distortion completely. You can get rid of the distortion at 25%, but why risk it? I keep it at zero now just to be sure. Doing so also reduced the overall volume, but since these things get plenty loud on their own, I don&8217;t mind at all.Usually I hate the looks of most Bluetooth headsets: the obnoxious blinking blue lights and the giant blobs of techno-crud clamped to peoples&8217; ears make them look like extras from bad 80&8217;s sci-fi movies. I have to say that the Motorola Buds practically disappear, especially while wearing them under the collar of a polo shirt. They do have an indicator light, but it is nestled in between the power switch and charging port, so it&8217;s not visible at all while they&8217;re being worn. I have to say, at first I wasn&8217;t too pleased with the fact that even the black headset has white bits on it (the undersides of the flat cords, the silicone ear pieces, and the forward/inside halves of the earbud shells). I have changed my mind and have very much come to enjoy the subtle high-contrast design. It looks nice and modern without looking like it&8217;s trying too hard. As I said, it practically disappears under a polo collar &8211; all you can see is the white silicone ear pieces and a touch of the white from the cord. When you&8217;ve got an earbud inserted, the white flash from the undersides of the cords help make it a little more obvious to others that you&8217;re either listening to music or talking on the phone. I say &8220;a little&8221; because people still give me weird looks when they walk into a room while I&8217;m in mid conversation. I have to make the universal &8220;I&8217;m not a lunatic, I&8217;m just on the phone&8221; gesture to most folks, but the observant ones can figure it out for themselves more easily. I see these now come in blue, which makes me even more sad that they don&8217;t come in red. You see, I have a sickness. A sickness which has yet to be defined (or even acknowledged) by Science, in which I have an overwhelming love (some, like my wife, would say &8220;unhealthy obsession&8221;) for black things with red trim, or red things with black trim, or&8230;  well, you get the idea. If these came in red, I&8217;d sell 4 of my 5 pints of blood (or at least my black/white Buds) to get a set. Maybe one day.Those are the main points I wanted to talk about. There are a few more things that don&8217;t really fit in the review elsewhere, so I&8217;ll stick them here. The specs say that the wireless range is up to 150 feet, but that is with a &8220;Class 1 Bluetooth device&8221;, which your phone probably isn&8217;t. Realistic use is still around 30 to 40 feet, with minor barriers like walls and doors. I don&8217;t even know where to find a true Class 1 Bluetooth device, so get that 150ft range spec out of your head. Battery life seems to be pretty good, and although I try to charge the headset every night, I&8217;ve gone as far as 2 full workdays of mixed usage without running out of battery. They&8217;re rated at &8220;up to 12 hours&8221; of playback, but it&8217;s anyone&8217;s guess as to what that actually means. I talked about the silicone earpieces earlier, but forgot to mention that they come in 3 sizes &8211; small, medium, and large. The Buds come with the small ones installed already, but I found that the mediums were best for me. The earpieces on most of my other earbuds (both wired and wireless) are 99% interchangeable, but these are slightly different. The posts on the ear stems are a slightly smaller diameter than standard, so earpieces from other sets are a bit loose. Swapping other earpieces to the Buds would result in more sound leakage and result in poorer sound quality and bass response, and also put you at a much higher risk of having one of the earpieces coming off the stem and sticking in your ear. Trust me, you don&8217;t want that. Stick to the 3 sizes provided and find the one that best suits you. Use the biggest size you can stand, because a good seal is critical for good sound quality. Another thing I mentioned briefly was the Buds&8217; voice notifications. The Buds have a set of pre-programmed voice notifications built in that you&8217;ll hear as you turn the headset on and off, or change EQ settings, and maybe a few other commands. When you power it up, the headset plays a short musical tune and then a chipper female voice says &8220;Welcome to the Motorola Buds!&8221; When you connect to a phone or mp3 player, the same voice says &8220;Device 1 connected!&8221; The voice isn&8217;t too bad, but it took me a while to get used to. When you receive a phone call, it will play another tune at you instead of mirroring your phone&8217;s ringtone. I think it&8217;s a riff on the first few notes of &8220;Ride of the Valkyries&8221; but I could be wrong. The Buds also play a soft &8220;bloop&8221; noise every time you play or pause or adjust the volume. Other than these &8220;bloop&8221; noises, there is really no indication of whether or not the unit is even powered up. I mention this because if the headset loses connection it will automatically power down after 5 minutes to save battery. If you pick the headset up after a while and don&8217;t know what power state it&8217;s in, hit a volume button and listen for the bloop. The headset has yet to drop Bluetooth connection on its own, which is a first for all the headsets I&8217;ve owned and is kind of impressive. The very last thing I wanted to talk about (yeah, I made a list) is that there are very thin rubber strips that run up the undersides of each control stalk, which I think serve the purpose of covering the track the wires run through. A small section of one of these strips popped up after about a week and would not seat itself back down. I eventually decided that they are probably held in place by some sort of adhesive, since I could not get it to &8220;pop back in&8221;, so I placed the tiniest dab of Krazy Glue in there, wiped off the excess, and held it in place until it dried. This was about a month ago, and it has not popped back up yet.So that&8217;s absolutely every observation about the Motorola Buds that I&8217;ve made since I got them. If you&8217;ve read through all that, I salute you. I probably owe you 20 minutes of your life back. Sorry about that. Now on to the summary, which I promised at the start:For the tl;dr crowd, I wholly approve of this headset. It&8217;s the headset I&8217;ve been waiting quite some time for, and it&8217;s finally here. Features, fit, sound, and looks are all pretty much perfect, and it&8217;s hard to come up with a list of serious disadvantages. As I write this, it&8217;s available here for $58, which is quite a steal. The nearest competitor is the LG HBS-800, which normally goes for $130. Check these out &8211; I don&8217;t think you&8217;ll be disappointed.",Positive
"It worked good for a few months.  Gradually, it began loosing its quality. People have trouble hearing now.  I am also getting ""static"" and cannot use very much.  Works a little better in my cell phone than Skype.  Overall, I do not reccommend it.",Positive
"I was very happy with my HS820 for the first 3 weeks. It was comfortable and transmission was good. UNfortunately, it was defective and stopped transmitting.  I am giving it a good rating based on the performance up until it stopped working.",Positive
"It won't work with my phone. After 2 hours, I got it to connect, but it won't answer when I get calls or turn on when I want to make them. Plus there were obvious scuff marks on the device. It's made of cheap plastic and the charger has the old-fashioned two-prong adaptor. I'm going to start looking for a better device ... especially one that charges with the universal USB adaptor so I don't have to carry multiple cords with me.",Positive
I just love this bluetooth headset. It was so easy to pair up with my new Sidekick 3. I did not have to do anything except charge the headset and then turn it on. Thanks again Amazon.com for providing me another great product at such a great price. The sound quality is outstanding. People on the other end just know that I am talking on a landline phone until I tell them that I am on a Bluetooth wireless headset and they are astounded. I highly recommend this headset to anyone looking for a brilliant headset at an excellent price. The Motorola HS 820 is the bomb!!!,Positive
"This was my first foray into the BT department. I first had this paired to a Moto v551 then later to a RAZR v3 Silver and Black. The only shortcoming I can find is the method used to turn the unit on and off. There are times you think you have the headset turned off, but in reality you just redialed the last person called. The HS850 is a better designe here, but thats the only ""one up"" the 850 has on this headset. The volume and fitment of this 820 are much better than on the 850. I have only had 1 signal related issue and that was due to me being too far away from the phone. Overall a great buy!",Positive
"I have to think that some of the other reviewers have older phones, and therefore problems with the unit. It's my first bluetooth headset, but I couldn't be happier.P.S. People dissin' it because it doesn't work 25 feet from the phone or because it doesn't stay on your head when jogging? I guess I'm not as adventurous with my cell phone as some others...",Positive
"Bought one then a second one, I'm impressed, my phone is by the same vendor and I think it is... the worst phone I've ever had, but  this headset is comfortable and works with my phone and my wife's LG faultlessly.Be aware that there is no mute button, you'll have to use the phone for that.Lasted 1/2 of a year now junk, will no longer hold a charge",Positive
"I am not impressed.I don't know what the other reviewers are smoking. This device does not cancel out background noise. Listeners on the other end say I sound like I'm in a tunnel. Two strikes.As you can see from the pictures there is quite a distance between one's mouth and the ""pinhole"" for the internal microphone. There is no way to cancel out background noise lest your own voice be considered to be background noise. This is a defect in all devices that have a similar design.The earpiece is not suited for driving or walking. The ""ear attachment"" and its hinge is made of flimsy plastic. As a result the fit isn't tight enough. I often need to turn my head quickly while driving and it feels like the thing's going to fly off my head into the back seat. It's an extremely annoying distraction that you don't want to have while driving.On the good side, I don't have any problems hearing and the volume controls are very convenient to use.",Positive
"This is my first BT headset. The main reasons I chose this one were low price, small size/weight, and having seen a couple of people use this at work.Pros:The size/weight is so small as to be unnoticeable. I find the headset very comfortable for extended periods of time. Price-wise, it was the cheapest headset from a reputable brand when I bought it. Battery life is decent, probably 3+ days, although I tend to charge it about every two days. Great for driving or any time you want your hands free but can't use speakerphone.Cons:People whom I call have complained occasionally about the sound quality. Range is not great, sometimes 10 ft causes annoying ""I am about to disconnect"" noise. Because there is only one main button that is used for everything, it is very easy to accidentally activate voice dialing, last-number redial, etc. Initial pairing with the phone was not intuitive at all: who knew you had to keep the button pressed while trying to pair up? Finally, the blinking blue light on you temple makes you look like a robot!Recommendation:This is an OK first/small/cheap BT headset. If you talk a lot on the phone, look for something else. There must be headsets out there that provide better sound quality, longer range, and have more intuitive buttons and controls.",Positive
"It is not the ""greatest""  The sounds works fine on most calls.  it is not very good on call overseas.  people don't hear very well.  However, I am mostly satisfied with it.",Positive
"This headset is actually not a bad deal but it is not a great deal either.  The design of the unit does not lend itself to easy, long-term usage.  It constantly falls off my ear and it is a power hog.  I once got about 2 hours of usage from this device and that remains the record for battery life (Oddly, it takes about two hours to charge this battery from empty).  I am surprised that Motorola couldn't get a better battery or somehow get more usage per charge.The upside is that sound quality is great when you can hear people on the other line (the volume doesn't go up very high).  It's one-push button operation to answer and hang up calls is great.  Though it can sometimes be a little slow to register calls as I have received complaints that it takes me too long to answer the phone.Overall, I like the idea of bluetooth but I haven't found a great headset yet.  I would recommend that you keep shopping around and if you don't find anything else in the price range that you like, buy this one but beware of the limitations.There is one other upside:  I once accidentally used the charger that came with my wife's Motorola V276 phone to charge my headset.  When I compared the two chargers, they were identical.",Positive
"I'm using mine with the Jabra A210 non-bluetooth phone adapter and it works fine. I've used it in the office on my cellphone (handsfree allows me to type and talk with no wires) I use it in the car and it gives me great movement without wires. Very small clips around the ear and you don't even realize its there. Very pleased with this unit. I charge it overnight and it works all day from 530am till 11pm constantly receiving calls. I've had this for a about a week and I'll leave it on this weekend to see just how long it will last before running out of gas. I'm pleased with the quality of the Microphone and Earpiece. Can't believe just how well the mic works. I can shout and whisper and the volume is constant. This is my first bluetooth earpiece and I'm happy with it ! Some calls have slight distortion, but since other calls are crystal clear, I have to believe its the cellphone connection and not the earpiece.",Positive
This headset works fine. It fits perfectly over the ear. Volume isgreat! connects quickly. No echooo. Maybe all the nay sayers need abetter cell phone. I've tried three bluetooth devices and the HS820 isfar superior to the rest.,Positive
"and i'm fairly disappointed! i bought this little gem at a cingular kiosk in the mall for $80 and i am thinking it's going back before my 30 days are up! in summary, considering bluetooth still has some improvements to make, this is just NOT worth $80, period. even if this device worked flawlessly, it might be worth about $30 at best.here are my gripes:* it says it has a range of about 30 feet. hmmm...not really. i am even using this headset with a motorola phone (V505)and i can get about 20 feet away from it at best before the audio quality goes south. not the biggest deal in the world. even when i am close to the phone however, there can be some interferance (""crackling"") and distortion. usually mild though. it seems like my microwave interferes with it (when it's cooking)!* doesn't fit snugly on my ear. rather, it kind of ""hangs"" there. it doesn't have any kind of mechanism for adjustment, so here's hoping it fits your ear. using this headset while lying down is hard to do; the device doesn't seem to want to stay put.* drops the bluetooth connection every now and again, even when i am at close range.the ""good"":* looks cool! ;)* battery life seems to be pretty good.* small, lightweighti am going to look into some other options. this simply was a waste of money.",Positive
"I always thought it was obnoxious to leave your headset on all the time, but now i know why people do it. One you forget you have it on and two it's kind of a pain in the neck to setup. This particular product is pretty good, it pairs up well with my RAZR after saying yes to no less than three questions and works very well. The only complaint I have is it could be louder, but it serves my purpose.",Positive
"The audio is very soft of this headset.  I have to use one hand to push it against my ear each time I want to use it.  Also, it is always checking to make sure it is still connected to the phone, so it beeps every 5 to 10 seconds.",Positive
"I love this headset.  It's light, has good voice quality, louder earpiece volume than the phone itself (Mot V710) and the battery outlasts the phone.  A previous reviewer mentioned having to carry 2 chargers.  Motorola makes a Y adapter so you can charge both your phone and headset from 1 charger.  I think I paid under $10 for it but don't quote me.  I love the headset but when I'm in an airport, it picks up the background noise as loudly as my voice.  If it was noise canceling it would have gotten 5 stars.  One last note: My phone doesn't ring when connected to the headset so you must have the headset on to know you have an incoming call.  This is a complaint about the phone though not the headset.Update 03-05-2005I just bought an HS-810 because I keep getting complaints of background noise being louder than my voice.  I like it better but the 820 does have better incoming sound quality.  But all in all, I like the 810 much better.  The flip open design is especially nice.  Search for the HS810 to see my complete review.Update 07-21-2005My Motorola V710 went in the dunk a few months ago so I had to buy a new one.  The new software allows the phone to ring even when the headset is connected.  Much better.",Positive
"Lasted 3 months, lucky I have two(charge one, while using the other), the units last only for about 2-3 hours of use, hardly good for all day jobs.Like the fit though, but These items need to last the day.",Positive
"I am not impressed.I don't know what the other reviewers are smoking.  This device does not cancel out background noise.  Listeners on the other end say I sound like I'm in a tunnel.  Two strikes.As you can see from the pictures there is quite a distance between one's mouth and the ""pinhole"" for the internal microphone.  There is no way to cancel out background noise lest your own voice be considered to be background noise.  This is a design defect in all devices that have a similar design.The earpiece is not suited for driving or walking.  The ""ear attachment"" and its hinge is made of flimsy loose plastic.  As a result the fit isn't tight enough.  I often need to turn my head quickly while driving and it feels like the thing's going to fly off my head into the back seat.  It's an extremely annoying distraction that you don't want to have while driving.On the good side, I don't have any problems hearing and the volume controls are very convenient to use.",Positive
"At first, I was a bit leary about buying one of these, because I had heard that they were never loud enough unless you were in a very quiet place. NOT TRUE! I have to say I've had to turn down the volume on this before! Now, don't take that out of context, but this is a great product. I live in Texas and drive a loud truck, and I've been able to use this product driving down the road! I would definitely recommend this product. A great purchase for the money.",Positive
"This headset seems to work fine, but the audio quality is nothing to write home about, to the person on the other end of the line you will sound soft and like you are talking on a speakerphone. They will also hear a lot of background noise. I am much happier with the Cardo Scala 500 Bluetooth headset. It has much better audio quality and even comes with more stuff for about the same price.And, you may not really *need* a wireless bluetooth headset because you can just use a wired one or use your speakerphone. But I admit that it's sort of cool to be totally wireless-you can put the phone in your pocket or purse and be totally unencumbered by wires, which feels a bit safer and freer, especially while driving or when you have to work with both hands and talk at the same time for example.A note about the battery-do not store this unit (or your phone) in a hot car! Heat damages batteries and shortens their lifespan.",Positive
"I bought this to connect walkman type gadgets to my car stereo.  It worked well at first, but the wiring quickly started having problems.  The sound would cut out and I'd need to mess with the cable to find a position where the wires inside would be touching correctly again.  After 8 months, the wire is now completely detached from one of the plug ends.  Maybe the heat of my car played a role in the breakdown of the cable, but if that's how you're planning on use it, don't be surprised if it starts shorting out on you too.",Positive
"It does what it's supposed to.  Hook up my cell phone to my car so I can listen to my mp3.  I'm not a audio geek/master so I don't know if it's a good decibel or crisp bass or tremble, but songs seems to play well.",Positive
"We bought this item to replace a broken 3.5 mm cable we use to connect our FM modulator to our iPhone 4s.  We needed something with a thin piece of rubber over the plug so that it didn't catch on the after-market case on our iPhones.  this product worked great, and the price was excellent.",Positive
This is a basic cable.  It works and it is cheap.  There is not much else you can say about it.,Positive
"The A630 is another ground-breaking handset design from Motorola.  It showcases the ingenuity of American engineering when you see the QWERTY keyboard hidden underneath on this lightweight (4 oz.) cell phone.  It's stylish, too, and has great reception -- that is, where T-Mobile has coverage at all.  Compared to the Sidekick II and many other T-Mobile phones, the A630 has the best signal-keeping capability, but T-Mobile just sucks big time, unless you live right next to one of their sporadic cell towers.  Worse, their GPRS (data) network is slow and congested.  While surfing the web on the A630 is really cool when the network is accessible, for most part of the day the network is slow and often inaccessible.  We really need the govt to step in and mandate that these cell companies upgrade their networks first before charging consumers an arm and a leg for data services.",Positive
"Wife loved it as the ""Razr"" thin phone craze took over. Flip phone with keypad was nice. Used it 2 years with 0 problems.",Positive
"This phone is good for the price, but if you really want a good mobile email solution, get a Sidekick II.Positive:The A630 has good sound quality, and absolutely fantastic sound quality if you use a bluetooth headset. T-Zones service is an inexpensive way to gain access to your POP3 email accounts. It has a keyboard. You can download pictures to and from your computer using a bluetooth connection (I did this using my Mac).Negative:The built-in email software is very poorly designed. It is sloooo[...] It requires way too many key clicks to accomplish common tasks. The most common email commands are buried in the menus, the least common commands occupy the prime spots. Someone didn't think about this enough. It takes me 7 clicks to delete a message -- that's too much. They don't take advantage of the keyboard enough: The keyboard has a Delete key, but you can't use it to delete a message. That's a waste. Likewise, you have to scroll through your emails one...line...at...a...time. Why not use the space bar as a quick scroller, like in Outlook? To issue a command, you have to use the menu and arrow keys. They should have assigned letter or number keys to each menu command so you can navigate more quickly with single keypresses. (My old Sony-Ericsson phone had this feature)The case is pretty, but because it's perfectly symmetrical, you can't tell which end is up by feel alone. The keyboard is so slick that you can't dial by feel either -- you need to look. These are safety issues. (but if you have a headset, you can dial by voice)So far, the battery doesn't last more than a day with below-average use.The A630 is best for people who want bluetooth, and who primarily talk or text, and who use POP3 occasionally, or not at all.",Positive
"I have placed these in several of my phones since they first came out in the 1990s. I know that they made a big difference in my older phones that had physical antennae&8217;s which needed to be pulled out of the phone.  Since the phone antennae&8217;s have changed, I haven&8217;t been able to notice any significant improvements with these installed or without them. I install them now because I got some for free and this is probably what they are now worth. The level of improved reception is about as noticeable as the loss of cash that I paid to get these free signal boosters.",Positive
"This item does nothing to enhance the signal in your phone, I followed the instructions and applied the antenna as stated but no change in the signal strength. I guess that's the reason why they're selling so cheap. Do not waste your time with this product.",Positive
So far it's working as intended. I'm satisfied and the price is right. Easy instruction of how to install the booster inside your cell phone.,Positive

"I really enjoy this device--being able to check email and blogs and send IMs while out and about is really nice. However, it's kinda huge compared to a regular cellphone, and I found that to be a bit of a drag. My service agreement seemed kind of pricey,  and the coverage was poor (I couldn't get a signal in my own kitchen, and I live in the middle of a big city, not out in the country) and in the end, I've shelved this phone for a smaller one with a cheaper monthly fee.",Positive
"I started out with the sidekick color switched for a short time to the Blackberry 7100t and then came back to the sidekick II. I So love this phone. There is no other phone on the market that compares in many areas.Pro's -Super easy to use.Best messaging out therebest screen out therecrazy good data servicegood downloads for ringtones, games and appsGreat signal (I was in rural Kentucky and still got a signal)Very reliableBest Data/Voice plan with T-mobile -- I have been with T-mobile for 5 years or so and have tried other services during that time. No other service has provided any better phone, signal, or features for a lower or even a competitive price.Con'sIn order for service to remain good you have to periodically reset the phone. Dont know why, but when I do that it fixes any reception problems. T-Mobile techs said this was a good idea.That's it everything else is normal and great about this phone.Unless you need corporate email dont bother with the blackberry. It was the worst phone I have ever used.",Positive
"I've had my SKII fo a little over a month now and find it a good fit for my needs.  I am a business user, not a Snoop Dog groupie, and this is a VERY cool device.Coverage in my area (Austin, TX is good)and while I have not yet traveled away from the IH-35 corridor, I had good voice and data coverage all the way to the TX/OK stateline (as far north as I went). For $20/month all you can eat data, this is a screaming deal.  I don't find the web surfing that useful (speed is about like a 28kbps dial-up connection) but for email it is superior to the Blackberry 957 I used a number of years ago.  The interface for the phone and for email and the address book is great.  Far better than any Nokia phone I have ever used.  The intellisync software allows me to create use a separate address book in Outlook that I can then sync with the SKII with a one button push.  Very simple and means you can have an abreviated address book if you are concerned about having this infor resident on TMO/Danger's servers.  I agree with another reviewier that it would be better that this info is NOT resident, but if that's a concern, limit what you leave on the server.Drawbacks are no bluetooth, no resident memory for email, pictures etc, no removable memory stick and no easy way to create and use your own ringtones.Great things, great keyboard (nicer/bigger than Crackberry), intuitive interface/software screen size/clarity. Camera a nice feature, easy to email pics anywhere. A very cool and functional device if you need phone and and email. The web and other stuff are ""OK"" but TMO data network will have to get faster and more WAP coded websites for content that is relevent for that to be a big reason to buy/use this device.I purchased through Danger's website total cost $0 after $200 instant discount and $100 in rebates. Worth a year's contract with TMO in my book.  Paying $49/mo for 3000 regional anytime minuets and $20/mo for all you can eat data (email, text messaging, etc, etc EVERYTHING DATA included).I would recommend this to anyone that really needs email and occaisional web service in addition to phone service.  Not the smallest/best coolest phone, but the best convergent communication device on the market right now IMHO.",Positive
Pro's:Very easy to use.Qwerty keyboardOTA (Over The Air) software upgrades that add usability to it once or twice a year.Full buddy list loading for AIM and YIM.Synchs to both Windows and Mac computers.Large clear screen.Allow for export of web bookmarks.Use up to three Pop3 or Imap4 email addresses with it.Con'sNo external memory.limited camera memory.no Bluetooth.no spell checker for the emailNo Microsoft Exchange email support so no corporate email unless it is a Pop3 or allows you to login from the web.Overall an excellent device.,Positive
"I give it five stars - despite some technical problems:You can send and receive vcfs in e-mail attachments - but you can't always file them when you receive them. They are rendered well enough such that you can move the material manually.  This varies - as long as they have a filename that ends in .vcf and a mime type of text/x-vcard or text/directory, and otherwise are formatted correctly, they will get taken. But, some applications, for example, evolution, that great Linux e-mail application, does not give something that was never a file a meaningless filename, so the sidekick will not file evolution's vcards (unless you export them to a file and resend them with the right mime type).Rather than picking the name of the vcard for import out of the vcard's formatting, the sidekick uses the filename. This might mean that it would be simply to pass garbage through the vcf interface, so be careful.You can get URLs in SMS messages and they show up as URLs, but you can't click on them. You can't click on URLs out of the AIM browser - you can copy the text and mail it to yourself, then click on the URLs out of the mail, where it pulls them out and makes them clickable at the end.The documentation says that the phone has a WAP browser. You might say, ""With a regular browser, why would I care about a WAP browser?"" - The answer is bandwidth - you want to look up a phone number, WAP will be faster.  And there are some cool wap games. But the real answer, according to the T-Mobile Tech supervisor is that the WAP browser is vaporware - it does not work.  Maybe someday.  There are sites you can't browse without javascript that have working wap analogues (like microsoft's sms generation site).  So you can't browse them at all from the phone.That is about it.  Most of the rest is great. I moved my Nextel data over by exporting the data from the Nextel site, and, in openoffice, I rearranged the column names to match what would have been exported from Outlook Express, and then imported.  Oh, yes, I also built names with a formula. Saved it as a comma file, just like Outlook had, and, poof, in about a minute, a couple hundred phone numbers, addresses, and names migrated and merged and appeared on my phone.  I could have mailed vcfs for the 70-80 contacts that I was using, but that didn't work.I've resisted all the games (I want MINESWEEPER - yes, I know it is lame).  I might have to drop $4 for solitare.I did drop $10 for the terminal program, and it has already become helpful - the terminal program is wonderful for something on such a tiny device. I can check out servers by connecting to them in raw mode, by port. I can ssh, securely, to my server. There are lots of disconnects, mostly related to when you stop typing to think for a couple of minutes, but a program available in Linux called ""screen"" allows you to save programs running in the background and reconnect to them, see their output, get status, and all that stuff. I can even get on IRC using a character mode IRC client.Someone called me to fix something on a weekend - it was something I could have fixed in 5 minutes on a real terminal, it took eight on the tiny terminal. In many ways, emacs seems to work better than vi does in character mode, but they both work.One secret is that you can log in to your windows box using ssh in character mode using free products from cygwin or SFU (from Microsoft if you have pro). Command line only, sorry.To echo the comments about the AIM client, which is utterly reliable vs. the yahoo client, which drops and reconnects all the time, is probably worthwhile.The documentation suggests that you surf with graphics off for speed. But many buttons are graphical and, unlike every other character or graphics off browser that simply displays the alt text, or, if there is none, ""[IMAGE]"", the button completely goes away, which means that you can't access what the button points to. This essentially means that you have to leave graphics on to surf.Occasionally, web sites are mis-represented - on eBay, for example, there is an extra entry bubble generated between the search text bubble and the putton you push - if you enter text there (which seems the right place) searches don't work.Despite all these niggling problems, and t-mobile's hapless tech support, I am still giving this device five stars. The astounding thing about a poker playing dog is not that it wags its tail when it has a good hand, but that it can tell that it has a good hand at all.The difference between getting text directions and being able to pull up a map of the area you are in as you drive down the road is wonderful - and then javascript stops you from being able to pull up a turn by turn map as you need it.I did not expect to have something in my hand that would allow me to log in to my system using ssh, browse at all, much less pull up mapquest maps.",Positive
"The Sidekick 2 has a better form factor than the competitors such as Treo 600/610 and Blackberry offerings. It has a better more comfortable keyboard. It's more like a mini computer than a phone, which I like. It can fully multitask, unlike Palm. You can download a webpage, check email and chat on AIM all at the same time, unlike  on the Palm, which will interrupt the process if you leave the application. Further, the Sidekick II has both AIM and Yahoo! Messenger.I like the built in camera and I find I don't miss having a Palm at all especially now that you can use Intellisync with the Sidekick 2 to sync all your contact/calendar information with your desktop computer. I never really liked stylus input on the Palm anyway and again the keyboard on the Sidekick is a lot better. The Blackberry units are nice however I still find the Sidekick more cool, easier to use and it has better instant messaging capabilities.My only slight complaint is that the Sidekick 2 does not have a replaceble battery. I would much prefer to be able to swap out the battery.",Positive
"I have used a lot of screen protectors for my iphone, and this one is the best. I'm happy to finally have a clear screen cover that works. For the past two years I wouldn't even try them, using only the anti-glare covers. Then I would get tired of the anti-glare covers because in my opinion they detracted from the attractiveness of the screen.This cover looks great; you have to look real close to even realize there is a cover on there (wasn't the case with previous clear covers I had used). Boxwave sent me cleaning supplies with the two covers - that made it very easy to apply without getting any dust caught in between. And finally, finger prints do not show up as readily as they do when there is no cover.Nice screen cover. Highly recommended.",Positive
The order was delivered on time and the clear touch is nice fit for my Galaxy S4. I ordered the anti glare version and it is easy to apply w/o any air bubbles. The protector works nice on the sun light. Also no finger prints or marks visible. Would definitely recommencement.,Positive
"Absolutely love this screen protector. It came on time and the product was just as expected. I love how it comes equipped with everything you need to install it. A wetnap, dry nap, cleaning cloth, and the flattening clip you use to even out the protector once its on. It looked very professional and my Galaxy S4 Screen looks SUPER vibrant and clean. You can not even tell that theres a screen protector. I would recommend this screen protector to anyone because the value surpasses the price. Afforable and efficient.",Positive
Just recived my screen protectors and there amazing. They came packaged very well. They come with a very thivk cleaning cloth and some wet and dry cleaning wipes. Once I put on protector on it was really clear no problems at all great feeling to the protector it was cut really well. Will defenetly buy more when I need them wont be using another protector but boxwave.. very satisfied (:,Positive
"Oh my, crystal clear... stands up to its name. ..absolutely easy directions to follow... No lint. . my screen looks like it has no protector on it. I am very careful with my device, so I do not know how it will handle items scratching the screen or fingerprints..I received it quickly, and I didn't have to pay for shipping, plus because I bought one item, received this packet for free. It comes with two screen protectors. If you follow the directions, you should not need the other. I have purchased others, and followed the directions and still end up with lint underneath... YES, I would recommend this item. ..It is a must have for your phone. ..",Positive
"I'm a lover of all gadgets and always have to get the ""coolest"" cell phone out there at the time.  This phone has been really great over the past 14+ months that I've owned it (I have the blue version).  I've not had ONE problem with it doing anything it shouldn't do (i.e. randomly powering off, antenna problems, etc).  I cannot say that for every cell phone I've ever owned.  LG makes a great cell phone and within their different models, I think this one is the best I've seen so far.  My brother has this exact model and loves it, too.The phone has a beautiful color screen, easy to navigate menus, a nice camera and video function, and OUTSTANDING battery life.  The only complaint I will echo is that it would be nice at times to have a speakerphone.  Other than that, this cell phone is the best I've found - including several other LG models that friends and family own.",Positive
I had it over 3 years and it was working great. Battery lasts very long. Phone is very durable and solid.,Positive
"I regret buying this phone, it's really big, and verizon service isn't that great with this phone.  For some reason other verizon phones have like 3 bars when mine has 1, or will have 1 bar when i'm getting no service.  That said, the phone does have a beautiful inner LCD, the outer LCD is pretty bad.  You can play with the settings. It has loads of features like alarms and calanders and everything else you could think of.  The camera is terrible, which is pretty much true with all cell phones though, so that's a non unique gripe. The phone is also moderately fruity, like when you make or recieve calls, the outer LED will start blinking purple, blue, pink etc and it makes you look like a teenage girl, and the menus are all kind of childish.  That said, when the phone does have some bars, calls never drop and it's pretty easy to set up the phone.  I'm not sure what other options there are out there for verizon cell phones, i recently switched from tmobile, but im sure you can do better than this phone, good luck.",Positive

"Ok, so I used to have a Motorola T720 (one of the worst phones made), and a Motorola Timeport 8767 (One of the best phones ever made).  I needed a new phone and ventured into the local Verizon Wireless store.  I happen upon the LG VX7000 and think...this thing is huge!  I don't need a camera in my phone...but then I pick it up and play around with it.  It's pretty comfortable to hold.  The screen is nice, bright and clear.  I wind up purchasing one from VZW online and when the phone arrives, I put it to the test.This phone so far for me has been terrific! The phone itself is a tad larger than my last T720 but not by much...the main LCD is a nice bright TFT screen.  Included are some wallpapers, 3 ""real"" pics(A Sunset scene, an island scene, and a group of people scene), a Verizon Logo wallpaper and a few ""doodle type"" cartoony pics.  You can change the settings for the display easily, as the UI for this LG is much better than my old Moto.  The front LCD is nice enough...you can also set a wallpaper here or use a pic taken from the camera to use as a picture ID when that person calls.Ringtones...kinda forgettable (I am beginning to think cell phone providers tell phone makers to make some pretty useless ringers so you download decent ones).  You can however, record your own which sound surprisingly good with the internal mic, as well as download them from Verizon's Get It Now Brew service.  You can also, use MP3's as ringtones through a little trick.  One think I like...this phone is loud!!  I can hear it ringing in a crowded shopping mall even.  The vibrate feature works well enough and can be activated quickly (though this requires you to flip open the phone).The camera is located where the ""hinge"" of the flip would be and rotates so you can snap a pic of yourself without contorting your face and arms to face the lens.  You can also change some pic settings like black and white and sepia tones, etc.  The camera is quite decent for a VGA cell phone camera.  There is a flash though this is rather useless except for close up pics.  The camera also lets you take 15 sec video clips which you can save and email to your friends.  While I figured I'd never use this feature, I have twice already.  The advantages of having the camera/video in something you always carry is quite nice...it's fine for candid moments and though your friends might know you have a camera phone, they won't probably guess you're video recording them. :DThe call quality is nice,loud, and clear...much better than my old cell phone. Battery life for me has been approx. 5 days with light usage and charges in a little over 2 hrs.  Mind you, the old ""blue versions"" of this phone had a charging plug near the data port...the new ""black face"" ones charge straight through the data port.The holster that came with mine (the black vx7000) was great...solid and not cheapy like some phones are.  Notice that the face of the phone flashes colored led's near the ""flash"" when you receieve a call or are making one...some like it some don't.I like the phone and it's size is deceptive. Tonight I showed it to a friend and she said, ""that thing is huge!""..then we compared it to her Panasonic camera phone and she noticed...hers was bigger lol.  This is one of Verizon's best cell phones right now...highly recommended.",Positive
"I get significant transmission static with this headset with my I-mate Sp3i unless I point the phone directly at the headset from a few feed away. It has static if I put the phone in my shirt pocket! Since I haven't done a baseline test of the phone with other bluetooth headsets, I can't say if it is the headset or the phone, but either way, if you buy one of these and have the same problem, make sure and return it within the return period.Another problem is the plastic ear holder (the part that holds the headset to your ear). This is a bad design and honestly, there is no way to get this thing to properly and confortably fit my ear. The only way to wear it is to have half your ear lobe hanging out, which result in a lot of pain within 10min or so. Avoid this headset if you want wear a headset for extended periods of time.A final note: The wind blocking technology works well, but at the expense of a high quality sound transmission to your recipent. I've asked a few of my techno-geek-friends when I'm talking to them with the headset, and they all say that the sound quality seems to be missing a full dynamic range.Good luck!",Positive
"I bought the Logitech after reading numerous reviews on various brands.  I use the device with a Motorola V551 phone (Cingular).  It works geat!  It charges very quickly and the charger folds up in a compact fashion when not in use (the electrical prongs fold up into a recess in the charger). The unit holds a charge for a long time.  I left it in a drawer for a month, pulled it out and it was still ready to go!I use the device a couple of times a month on business, when driving, etc.  The windscreen is outstanding and cuts out noise even when driving with the window open.  some people complain about the ear piece.  It seems fine to me and you can adjust it easily, but keep in mind any headset is an annoyance when you first wear one.  Then it becomes second nature.the sound is great, the phone detects the device quickly, its fairly comfortable. All it all it performs just like a device twice its price,",Positive
"Its the only bluetooth headset I've used, so I don't have anything to compare it with.  Has made my ipaq 6315 much more usable as a phone.  Sound quality is good, some people say I sound far away, I'm experimenting with the gain on the ipaq, we'll see if that helps.  It was a little tight for me at first (big ears), I was able to bend the part that goes around the ear a little and its much better now.  Great battery life.Would be nice to have an external ringer on it, so I could hear it ringing or vibrate if I were away from the phone.  Good range 15-30'.",Positive
"i had bought the motorola HS820 before this one for $80. i have a motorola V505 from at&t.; the motorola worked pretty well, but i thought $80 for a bluetooth headset was way too much. i returned the motorola and picked up the logitech instead and for 1/2 the cost, i was just as happy.it fits a little awkwardly on my ear, but so did the motorola, so i am thinking my ears are the problem. call clarity and voice recognition is good. battery life is good. weight on ear is good. overall, i am pretty impressed!i wish there was some way to adjust the tightness of the earpiece as it feels kind of loose on my ear. would also be nice if the ""on"" button wasn't so small that you covered it up with your finger when you turned it on, making it hard to see the flashing blue light.whenever i use my microwave, it makes the bluetooth connection drop. just warning ya'. ;)",Positive
"I've been using this headset for a few months and couldn't be more pleased with the battery life. It recently had no problems keeping up with a four hour Skype session!It is also capable of pairing with multiple devices, so you can for instance use it with your computer at home and your cell phone on the road without having to redo the pairing every time, something cheap brand-X headsets don't do.Logitech was kind enough to supply a very tiny charger, perfect if you take your headset on the road. For those international trips, no problem: it can handle 100 to 240 volts and 50 to 60 Hz (translation for the technologically challenged: you can use it anywhere in the world, just get a cheap prong adapter)On the negative side, it's possible to jam the connector into the headset the wrong way if you're not careful. Of course the battery won't charge up and the light won't go on, a dead giveaway. It caused no damage to my headset, but the connector design could be better.I found this headset very comfortable to wear for extended periods of time. The volume is loud and the sound quality is very clear. People on the other side liked the sound quality as well.There are a few negative points that cost this otherwise excellent headset a star:* after 10 minutes of inactivity, it goes to low-power mode ""sleep"". When the phone it is paired with rings, it may take up to 5 rings for it to wake up and start ringing. If you press the answer button before the headset starts ringing, you will lose the call. If you want to answer right away, you can always answer on the phone but if you do so pressing the answer button on the headset will not transfer the call to the headset like it did on my Sony Ericsson HBH headset, but hang up. To transfer the call to the headset, use the appropriate menu on the phone instead.* The ring on the headset is an irritating, non-modifiable melody. It would be nice to have a few options!* The headset is fairly large and dorky-looking.Despite these few drawbacks, don't forget that this is a very capable, well made and reliable headset at a bargain basement price, one of the best out there. If you can live with the looks, it's a super deal.",Positive
"the ""behind the ear"" thing just broke...I baby my stuff and treat it VERY lightly, and this piece of junk just fell apart!!!Very dissapointed!!!I should have made my additions to this review long ago, but Logitech cam through for me on this headset in a huge way! They immediately sent me a replacement of the headset, but not just a replacement, an $85 replacement! Then told me to keep the broken one, which I was able to fix with some Krazy Glue!Really incredible customer support...I will never hesitate to buy something branded with the Logitech name!BTW, 5 stars on the earpiece itself once it was repaired with the glue.",Positive
"I'm a great believer in spending as little as possible on glitz,bells and whistles, and generally go for performance and practicality. Sound quality and features are fine for the price.  But the unit is quite difficult to wear -- the boom is wide and boxy; the weight is unbalanced, as well.  I could not get a comfortable fit.  My ear is well within normal range of size and shape, but was bent out of shape by the headset.On the positive, wind noise and lost connections -- common criticisms of other BT headsets -- was not a problem here.  If you don't care about medium to long term fit and comfort, or the aesthetics of walking around with such an large unit hanging off your ear, you may be happy with this headset.  I wasn't, and am returning it.  I'm going to give the Cardo Scala a try;  if it's no good, I'll probably go with a Jabra, and spend a bit more money.",Positive
"I've had this for about a year.  It works great.  Great call quality, no static.  Battery life is real good.  The only bad part is this looks like a part of a males anatomy and I don't really want that on my head.  Otherwise great buy.",Positive
"Let me say a few things:Buy THIS device.  Here are the reasons:- 7-8 Hours talk time- True 30 feet range- Wind filter for clear talking- Small and comfortable, doesn't intrude your ear- Crazy price, huge quality- Warranty and reliability of Logitech!I've used a Sony Ericsson and Jabra BT200 and I would say the Jabra is much better than Sony Ericsson, but the Logitech blows them both away.  It's faster to put on the Logitech and the range is much better.  The microphone is clear and crisp and the speaker volume is loud and sufficient.For me, I used a Jabra A210 bluetooth adapter for a Sprint Sanyo 8100 phone w/2.5mm headset jack.  It gave me BT on my phone so I could use this headset.  The auto-answer and hang up depends on your phone whether it would normally do so with a headset or not.  Works great for me!If you are considering a headset, get this one.  It's what bluetooth technology should be like.  It's so great that Amazon sold out...  nice.  It was $39.99 (where did they all go???)",Positive
"I was a bit skeptical when I saw the price and read some reviews but I thought hey its Logitech it must be good.  I was right this headset is very comfortable compared to another headset I just bought.  The ear speaker is loud even to the point that I don't have to have it on the highest setting.  The mic was the thing I was worried about though, so I called my friend's cell phone and talked to myself and I was pleasantly surprised with the sound volume and clarity.  Also I haven't had any complaints from other friends I've talked to with the headset.  It has been my experience that Logitech makes the best wireless devices for the buck and they didn't let me down with this one (second Logitech wireless devices in two month; I also bought their xbox controller which is definitely also worth the buy.)",Positive
"The sound quality was excellent, but the earpiece is flimsy and irreplacable: terrific electrical engineering, poor mechanical engineering.I loved it when it wasn't broken.  Even wind didn't seem to bother the headset much.  The voice quality was great on transmission and reception.  But the earpiece is incredibly flimsy and can't be replaced.  I got a new headset the first time on warranty.  The second time it broke I could have gotten a free replacement again but I didn't want the hassle.  I have a Scala now that I've been using for months and I'm very happy with it, even though the sound and wind-immunity doesn't measure up to the Logitech.",Positive
"I have used it now for 2 weeks with a RAZR V3 and I am satisfied it works as advertised. It was very easy to pair the headset with the phone. The sound is good even in noisy environments. The headset is light, confortable and fits well.My only complaint is about the smart button used to turn on/off, answer, dial and pair. The button is also a LED indicator. The LED flashes diferently (different colors, intervals) for various modes but it is difficult to see the LED while pushing and holding the button. After a few days I got used to it and now I know how long to hold the button down to switch on/off, pair or use voice dial.At $42 it is a good deal.",Positive
"I bought the Logitech Mobile Freedom Headset (980228-0403) for use with VoIP on my HP zt3000 Windows XP SP2 notebook. I wanted to use a wireless headset and VoIP to make international calls, mostly from hotel rooms. This headset did not work out of the box for my situation. The Logitech support website was great. It said to upgrade the notebook's bluetooth software. The HP site was also excellent. I downloaded bluetooth and many other newer drivers. Once installed, the headset immediately worked as docuemented. The other newer drivers solved all the weird hibernation problems I've been experiencing too. I'm using Skype for VoIP service. Skype setup has an option for using the bluetooth headset for Skype only, otherwise the normal audio devices are used. All in all, installation was a bit of upgrade work but competently supported. I now have a VoIP connected wireless headset that allows me mobile freedom. Due to my usage, I have no comment on the audio quality or useability with mobile phones. The device apparently will not work with the majority of PocketPCs due to a lack of bluetooth software. Thus I only gave it 4 stars. However, HP does sell stereo headphones (no microphone) for most IPaq models.Update: 15-March-2005 Am able to pair with Axim x50v PocketPc. Has considerable static. Skype and other apps nearly unusable. Continues to work with XP well. Suggest Plantronics MX100I Stereo Headset for using Skype on a PPC.",Positive
"I have been using this for a month.PROS:It is a good value.  It works really well, and it lasts a very long time on a charge.  The WindStop feature works very well.  People have been able to hear me very well while driving and even while playing volleyball.  It stays on the ear well but is not uncomfortable.CONS:The unit looks okay but is less attractive than some of the other high-tech units on the market.  3 of my co-workers have commented that it looks like I am wearing a phallic symbol on my ear, which is really not the look I would like to achieve.",Positive
"Because I spent a lot of time on the phone, I am very particular about BT headsets.  I have tried every brand of BT headset you can imagine, I mean EVERY brand.  I was so frustrated to a point I was ready to go back to wired headset until I ran into this little guy.  This is by far the best one, hands down.  My most miserable experence was with Jabra and Motorola.  I had a lot of connection and audio quality issues with those brands.BT headset designers seem to favor visual appeal rather than performance.  I don't understand by most headsets on the market are short and stubby, in which the microphone is right next to your ear instead of your month.  Having microphone that far away results in having to turn up the microphone sensitivity, which cause the headset to pick up everything including background noise.  Lack of an effective noise-filtering system such as the one in this Logitech headset, you end up with wind noise, car noise, AC noise, every kind of noise but your voice.  In additional, the close promixity between the speak and microphone creates a feedback loop for a nice serving of constant echoing.  I lost count of the occasions when my friends and coworkers on the other end of the phone tell me to ""get off your crappy Jabra BT headset"" or ""take me off your Motorola BT headset"".  I am amazed that people on the other end can easily tell it's a Jabra BT headset because the horrid sound quality.Onto this gem, the sound quality is amazing, by far the best of the bunch.  The WindStop system really does work.  Together with the farther extending microphone, this unit produce the best sound both incoming and outgoing.  I know many users complaining about the fit, but it's really a fault of the user.  As one reviewer pointed out, there is a ""correct"" way to wear this, and I think it provides an excellent fit and comfort.I can't speak for all, but I personally don't wear a BT headset as a fashion statement.  I use it as a mean for convenience and safety, so sound quality and fit are top factors for my consideration.  On that note, this is a clear winner.  I wish product managers and designers at Motorola and particularly Jabra take note of that.  Jabra (250 and 250v models) being the worst with it's behind the ear design and a heavy-trigger button is really a very lousy product in terms of usability and sound quality.  I am sure customers that raved about Jabra would rank this unit out of this world!",Positive
Good reception. It fits OK on my ear but not perfectly. It seems sturdy. Price was better than most. The wind doesn't bother it much either.,Positive
"We bought the Plantronics HL10 Handset Lifter to go with ourPlantronics CS-55 Dect 6.0 Digital Wireless Office Headsetand have been very pleased with both devices. Using the handset lifter give you the ability to answer calls directly from the wireless headset, which is good if you spend a lot of time away from the physical phone to which the headset unit is connected.Setup was amazingly easy, just following the directions allowed us to get this installed in just a few minutes on our very inexpensive no-name speaker phone.Like our Plantronics Headset, this has passed the test of time and I would buy a new one if it failed today.Highly Recommended!CFH",Positive
"First of all, I must start out by saying that I am a little surprised that this little mechanical device is even necessary with all of the technological advances out there these days.  The HL-10 is kind of a ""throw back to the seventies"" in terms of its jerry rigging function.  Having said this...  Plantronics builds quality stuff and I am sure that there is a good reason for it.  The device does exactly what it is supposed to do once you adjust it for your individual phone.  I was a little concern that it would fit my phone but they include plenty of adjustment options to take care of any setup.  I am using it with a Plantronics CS351N  headset - which I love for it professional wireless function.  I tested the HL-10 by picking up/hanging up the headset 10 times in sucession and the lifter raised and lowered the receiver successfully each time.  That was good enough for me.  Definitely worth the $ if you own a wireless headset and you roam around the house/office while talking on the phone.",Positive
"There isn't much to say here.  For the phone system I have, this was needed to enable the remote functions of the  Plantronics-CS540 Convertible Wireless Headset.  It could be more aesthetically-pleasing, but as I'm sure it's designed for a wide variety of phones that need a remote lifter, I suppose you can't complain.Mounting the unit can be tricky.  You need to be certain it will work properly before you use the sticky tape to mount it in place.  So, you wind up holding it with one hand while working your headset to activate/deactivate it several times to be sure you've found the right spot for it.Comes with a special headset adapter for phones with shapes that offset the lifter bar.",Positive
"It looks strange stuck to the side of the phone, but we have an older Starpluss STS system that needs the handset lifted for a wireless headset to work properly.  This item was easy to set up.  It took about 10 minutes to unpack and install.",Positive
Our office phones lifters stopped working so I decided to take a chance on these lifters instead of having to order a whole new headset and so glad I did.  They work great!,Positive

The price is good and the cable is working well. I had a very good experience with this cable.,Strong Positive

This is a great idea! You have cases for phones so why not have one for your bluetooth. I have a Motorola HS850 earpiece and wanted to make sure that I would not lose or misplace it. This holder clips on to my car visor or my purse so it is handy. It fits my earpiece perfectly. I got one for my husband and brother for their bluetooth. You can't beat the quality or the price.

No one reviewing here had tried it with this device, but I wanted the functionality so I took a chance and ordered it anyway. It works perfectly! (Or what I've tried so far works perfectly - I haven't received any phone calls while listening to music yet.)Note that I'm running Windows Mobile 6.1. I think it may not work for devices running WM 6.0. The audio jack functionality was altered with the OS upgrade. It may work, though - can't say for sure. It's worth trying!",Strong Positive
